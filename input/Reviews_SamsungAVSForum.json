Hopefully some reviews come out soon.   The F8000 does have a true 240hz processor. Amazon can only advertise the true value in their title and it states 240hz for that TV. Seems like the only differences are a few little things like a new coating on the screen to improve contrast, a new software enhancement to improve depth of image, and a faster quad core processor for the smart TV system. IF those new image hardware / software elements do actually result in a improved image I guess I would go for the H8000 over the F8000 unless they give some crazy discount on the F8000 (as of right now they are way too close in pricing).. Personally looking for a 65inch and now that 65in 4k from Samsung and Sony are retailing for $4000 (and that will likely drop in a few months) wondering if its worth waiting and purchasing a more future proof 4K tv... I've been impressed with 4k content on larger screens, but seeing as how ill be sitting 10 ft away - wonder if ill note a difference. Big benefit I see is with 3D since it will be passive and 1080p to each eye (passive sets to my eyes are MUCH more comfortable for anything over 30 mins - I honestly don't think the active sets are good for vision, I'm in dental school not medical - but learned enough about eye anatomy to realize how eye strain can cause long term problems).. So its a conundrum.. "

I just figured they're trying to compete with Sonys Triluminous but if the F8000 had it I'm sure the H8000 is prob the same. I just think its a steep price for a 65in 1080p LCD in this day to be above the 3k price point (regardless of features). Like DRN94 noted, if the picture quality isn't greatly changed, i could care less for the smart hub either since I use my Apple TV and Oppo for everything.. So its all about picture quality, if the F goes on a decent sale id consider. The 2013 F9000 4k is actually $3500 right now - but I read some not so great reviews that turned me off to considering it, maybe the 2014 4ks will be improved. "

Yea so that was my concern - image quality (upscaling) since I have a decent blu-ray collection and motion handling.. Since it seems like 4k is going to be the new standard its just making me itch to get in on it, but you're right I think the current 4ks work at 30hz which causes a lot of motion blur, even at 60hz it won't look anything like the 240hz 1080p sets. It'll be a while before they fix that problem so I guess the most logical is F vs H8000 right now. Wait a few weeks to see how the H8000 reviews fare and how the F8000 prices change. "

		"description": "   I am shocked with the contrast ratio numbers on the H8000 in that review. The black level on the H8000 is almost twice that than on the F8000. Uniformity has also suffered, probably because of the difficulty of evenly distributing light across a curved screen. My F8000 has nearly perfect uniformity with no DSE whatsoever, the F8000 was praised for it's backlight uniformity. Now I'm even more glad I got the F8000. This is rather bizzare. Sony's W950B 1080p flagship for 2014 was supremely disappointing compared to the previous W900A flagship. And now Samsung's 1080p flagship is rather disappointing as well but not nearly as much as the Sony. Honestly, if you're into a 1080p set get the F8000. If you're interested in a 2014 set rather than the F8000, the flat 4K flagship may be the best option. That H8000 review also states that the 4K curved model has similar backlight uniformity issues. I foresaw these quality problems many many months ago as manufacturers were looking towards gimmicks to sell their TV's and not improve the picture quality. The W950B was a HUGE step backwards in terms of picture quality and the H8000 is a slight step backwards as well (lower contrast ratio, poor uniformity). Stay away from both of these TV's. "

But I am sure that the Samsung website said local dimming for the H8000 and the 4k model above it (just checked). As far as the F8000.. the reviews I read stated pretty significant uniformity issues without engaging the local dimming (but excellent uniformity after that was engaged). For those that had no issues even with it turned off I guess it may have been luck of the draw. I know I was pretty unlucky with my first 60in 7100 and 2 Sony 850As. But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.

		"description": "     I really cannot find any fault with this TV. We all know about standard definition feeds but this TV seems to handle even the crappiest feed rather well. High definition and blu-ray are nothing short of spectacular. I was watching football on Sunday and the hi def images were razor sharp and crystal clear. In close-up shots of the field you could almost count the blades of grass. I saw no motion blur at all especially when the camera pans during a long pass.  Regarding what Ken said about the \"fault finders\" once they find a fault then they can't unsee it. The best way to avoid that is to not look for it. Just sit back and enjoy what is surely the best(IMHO)1080p HDTV on the market today.  "

They also have free shipping and a 60 money  back guarantee. You also get lifetime technical support at no extra cost. I have bought 4 televisions from them and every one arrived in perfect condition. They use UPS freight for shipping.  Depending on where you live, shipping takes 2 to 3 days. Visit their site and call them. You can place your order over the phone which is the way I ordered mine. They are a first class operation and will answer any questions you might have. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.        I live in KC.  Do you know if they charge tax? "

One thing I will say, Crutchfield does not offer white glove delivery so if you want the driver to stick around while you examine the TV, be prepared to offer a nice tip. As to which panel I can't say whether or not all 55 inch models have the TS01/02 panels.  Setting up the TV is not hard and one person can handle it easily, you just have to be a little careful. These TV's are well packed and there are detailed instructions on how to handle it and installing the stand. Where ever you get it from, you are going to be extremely happy. "

The viewing experience is completely different :-) If the H8000 has any flaws I don't notice them, I just enjoy the great, to me, picture  I'm not a gamer so I have no idea as to that side of things. Only thing connected to the set is my BP through a Denon AVR.  Stepping up from 23\" is huge! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do, and I believe many other owners of the set do also.       Blu-Rays are so much fun. I can't wait to really see them for the first time.     Quote:        Originally Posted by AncientAlien      Has the 55\" been discontinued?

It was from PC Richards which was a NY to CA delivery. I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don't know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don't have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it's also the most money I've ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don't even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray. "

The picture is amazingly more crisp and sharp from the factory settings. One thing I wanted to ask is there a way to make the picture quality less \"Soap Operaish\"? I remember I bought a LG led, and that was was the worst Soap Opera effect setting I have encountered but there was a setting which allowed it to take it off. Is there something for the Samsung as well? Thanks to everyone for sharing there experience with this tv set on this thread. "

Apparently Samsung keeps it on Auto, why I have no idea, not everyone loves the Hobbit Special effect look. So anyhow if anyone is wondering why there tv image is looking like a Soap Opera effect, there you go, turn of the auction motion plus or keep it on Clear. I found the Clear setting to be nice and smooth during fast motions.  Cheers! "

Cheers!       I hope you're right!  When you go to enable game mode though, it even says in the little description box \"There may be a slight degradation in graphic quality.\"  That's the understatement of the century.  I swear it makes my PS3 games look like PS2 games, and completely destroys the vibrant colors this TV is capable of producing in the other modes.  Everything looks flat, like on a cheap Vizio.  Why would they need to dumb down the colors in order to reduce input lag??  Anyway, Samsung is supposedly going to have someone contact me to try and find a solution.  If they can't, I've already made up my mind that I'm going to swap the H8000 for a Sony KDL50W800B instead (same TV as I had before, only bigger &amp; 120hz).  Sad because I know the KDL50W800B will be inferior to the Samsung in every other way, but the game mode on the H8000 is just not going to work for me unless there's some sort of workaround. "

My Directv channels vary quite a bit - HBO, Showtime, BBCA look consistently great, while other shows - especially dark looking ones, like 'Sleepy Hollow' can have significant blocky artifacts in dark areas. And some shows look sharp and in focus, while others look soft. But Blu-Rays look fine, so I believe it is not the set, but the quality of the broadcast from Directv, which of course is compressed quite a bit.  Have you tried calibrating your set? I have been able to both improve the Directv picture and hide many of the artifacts by changing the settings on mine. "

Maybe I was expecting more   Release prices are generally more than I'm willing to pay so if I come across a good price I'll pick up something I want.  Post your impressions.

		"description": "   I've been looking at this tv for a while and when it came on sale I bought yay. So happy after all the hassle I had with my old phillips.  The tv looks great, the colors are very nice and the tests I've seen in a few different shops was great.  But when I watch a movie via my computer(connecting like a second screen) I am not happy with the results at all. Its a bit choppy, nothing like the tests at the shop. It feels like the hz is very low and I get frustrated and instead just watches the movie on my computer screen.  I also tried copying the movie over on an usb and tried connecting to the tv, same issue, not impressed.  Is there any settings I can change? After 2 years back and forth with phillips I'm so feckin angry I could explode. Why won't my tv just work? "

I compare it to my brothers 50 inch LG and i feel like he gets a consistently better clearer picture on Cable channels.. he has Verizon Fios Cable while i have directv.. Im tempted to exchange this set for a 70LB7100 LG.. but i see a lot of mixed reviews for it I tried playing some movies from my laptop connected to the tv via HDMI cable.. and it did look like crap I transferred some of the movies over to an external drive, and connected it directly to the tv using USB.. and they played significantly better.. Dont really understand that either... If i change a channel, i feel like i have to adjust the settings every time.. "

But I wasn't exactly looking after it either because I asumed everything would be allright. I'll certainly look closer next time.  It's not like its a HUGE problem, something you notice straight away or is very easily noticable. But there is always this feeling something is not right and when I look closer its good or pretty. So its making very uncertain if its a fault with the tv or just me having too high expectations.  On the other hand my old phillips felt smoother than this one, so that really should says something.

I set up an exchange with Best Buy and then quickly canceled it after I saw these comments from another thread in here for a similar tv and then played around with them  My general settings where I get no flash lighting are Standard, brightness 34, backlight 3-7 (night time, nice and dark) but change it to 10-15 (daytime when blinds are open. I will notice flash lighting when I go 7+ on backlight or higher than 34 on the brightness), Contrast 90, Eco mode off, Dynamic Contrast LOW (This I feel pops the picture slightly without losing detail in the color gradients any higher I notice the grey bar deviate too much from the true picture), and Dark for the black level ( this I feel makes sure the image source is always getting black in the picture to improve the contrast, any higher and you get black crush), sharpness is set to 40, color 50, Tint I think off the top of my head was 44/56 or somewhere around there. I noticed the set had some slight green hue, so I had to trim that and add some red. I used the TV's blue color filter with some CD calibration tool I downloaded here. For the picture I use Cool (sports) or Warm 1 (movies/TV). I have LED motion off, Cinema Off, Motion rate is set to Clear, HDMI level is LOW. I found that the HDMI level low gives me the best deep blacks especially at night. But I counter it with gamma +3 to bring out any dark shadows in the picture. Reason why is that When I look at cable content I notice that since the Cable HD source quality is lower than that of blue ray or video games the deeper grey/blacks sometimes get lost. The increase in gamma brings it out. However if that is not enough for the content I'm viewing I bring it back to Normal, But that's pretty rare...the content has to be a very low quality such as a poor video stream. The mpg stuff I leave on auto I like it since it makes the picture look better on downloaded movies I view with lower quality on such a big set. Blue Ray or Video game content looks phenomenal and feel like it has a nice color range with HDMI Black Low. I think that's it for my settings.  What has made an impact for me with this tv is  standard mode- backlight 16-18 (i change this based on what im watching) brightness 43-47 (same as above) dynamic contrast - high gamma- +3 digital clean view - high or auto MPEG noise filter- high or auto sharpness 30-40 Auto Motion Plus - clear Smart Led- Low  Once i switched to these, i got caught watching 300 Rise of An Empire on cinemax.. and stayed up way late.. and couldnt stop watching..

First off, let me say that this will be my last post on this God forsaken forum period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  truerogue With all of the futzing and tinkering you do I wonder if you will ever really be satisfied(I don't think so). Then you sit there and say \"I can see flashlighting with these settings but not with the other settings. The only reason you see flashlighting is because you are sitting there looking for it. You seem to be searching for the perfect picture. If there was a perfect TV, AVS Forum wouldn't exist because there would be nothing to complain about. Perhaps you should return the TV and listen to the radio, but you would probably find something to complain about whilst doing that.  As I've said before, I believe the Samsung H8000 series HDTV is one of the finest TV's on the market today. I sure am enjoying mine.   GOODBYE  AVS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    "

Some do seek perfection, he and I are both more laid back in that area and do not look for imperfections but others are certainly free do so Hang in with us, you may help someone new to the H8000  All the best, "

		"description": "     Hello. Per reviews I've read and recommendations on this forum I decided to buy the 55\" H8000 HDTV. I must say I'm quite pleased with it. THERE IS a difference between the H8000 and my former 32F6300 in terms of image quality. It's just a pleasure to watch it.  As one of the main purposes of my tv is to play video games (mostly PC games via my PC and some PS4 ones) and being accustomed to the great performance in that matter of my F6300 I must say the H8000 is quite as good as the F6300 but the F6300 still leads in terms of lag but the differente is nothing to talk about. In fact all reviews have given the H8000 a GREAT test result in gaming performance and I agree.  The PC mode works fantastically well. I am attaching two photos I took while playing Max Payne 3 with my PC all settings at full. The image and sense of immersion is really UNBELIEVABLES. Words cannot describe the feeling you just got to experience it first hand. The imperfections/pixelations shonw in the photos are because of my iPhone camera NOT the TV.  The only bad thing is that yesterday, just one week after buying it I discovered a RED STUCK PIXEL right in the middle of the screen that is quite noticiable although it's only one. Of course it's noticeable mostly only in dark/black screens but this tv it's a beauty showing black images so that's really a pity.  I read stuck pixels are more treatable than dead pixels. I tried the jscreenfix solution for about 20 minutes and although the intensity of the red stuck pixel diminished it went back again after some time. Then I tried this other site: www.flexcode.org and I noticed that just starting it the red stuck pixel light diminished more and then I left it also for about 20 minutes. The light have diminished but still there and last time I saw there was no light. It was very late at night so I couldn't keep trying but before turning off the TV I almost saw no light on the red stuck pixel. I don't know if the stuck pixel will come back but at least it diminished with said methods and that is saying something. Hopefully I can fix it. Though I'm a little OCD about it it's certainly disturbing to have said stuck pixel. "

Today I accidentally turned off my TV from the remote control and then immediately turn it on (after 4 to 5 sec). There was no picture on the screen, but sound was coming out from the speakers. I could switch the channel, but again no picture nothing on the screen. Then I turned it off again, waited for 1 minutes and turned on. The picture was back. Updated firmware to the latest version, but it didn't fix the issue.  It looks like software problem, but I didn't find any claims about the same issue on forums. Or maybe better to replace it? "

Only thing I've noticed is that voice can be really faint, I sometimes have to crank the volume to 50 even though there's no sound in the apt and the TV is like 10 feet away. The clear voice sound option helps but then everything sounds washed out. Hoping the Soundbar will help with that by providing more balance across the range. "

		"description": "   Hi there. So as I \"suffer\" a \"little\" OCD and couldn't find the correct  fit-all height for my TV and tried and tried a lot of possible  configurations and furniture I decided the way to go was to have the TV  attached to a TV mount. One TV mount with height adjust, tilt adjust so I  could move up or down, forward or back and tilt my TV as I needed. This  because when I play video games with my TV I seat near and when  watching movies I sit far and when watching music videos not to far not  to back...anyway.  There isn't a lot of options but I bought the  best one being that I could easily say this is the best commercial  available TV mount on the market: The Omni Mount Play 70.  I  installed with some professional help and words nor picture do justice  for how beautiful the TV looks. It looks like it is suspended in the  air. I can recommend this TV mount 100%.  I have attached some pictures. Please excuse the low quality of the iPhone pictures. "

I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don't have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it's also the most money I've ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don't even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.       Hi Neo,  As to the panel version, look on the end of the packing box. There should be an area that tells you the Model and serial number as well as the Version:, that may be a TS01 or TS02... Or you can find the label on the back of the set on the opposite side of the connector inputs.  I'm one of those folks who likes the curved screen. My engineer brain points out that when I look from the center out to the edges, from where I sit, the distance is almost the same. So what that means is the pixels are straight on, seems optimal to me. If I do the same with a flat screen, as I look to the edges I am looking at an ever increasing angle, i.e. the distance is further away as I look to the edges, just like moving off to the side from dead center. Just my view of the curved screen. I love my 55H8000.  The sound is much better also as I finally have my Denon 4520CI all hooked up. Just need to do a bit of clean up and run Audyssey. Even so, it sounds pretty nice  Also thinking of adding a second subwoofer, maybe SVS SB-2000 or SVS PC-2000... Although after watching U-571 last night I'm not sure I need anymore impact during the depth charge attack "

Number four: If you have the opportunity, audition one in person at a big box store like Best Buy, Abt, PCRichard, HHGregg etc.  And finally, I would never buy an open box, no matter how attractive the price  Of course, you are entitled to do what you wish, but I'm hoping you will take my four points into consideration.  One more thing. I can strongly recommend Crutchfield. They are an authorized retailer. They offer a 60 day money back guarantee, free shipping and free lifetime tech support.

Picture quality rated by most as better than anything out there. We are still using a 50\" 8 year old Panasonic plasma but it still looks good and only has 15,000 hours on it. Really hesitant to buy now but we're not so sure the Panny will make it until prices start falling on our preferred OLED TVs. A couple of grand for retired fixed incomes is a hard decision but we do love the big screens/great picture. "

I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don't have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it's also the most money I've ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don't even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.       For gaming you don't need to set an input name to PC on this particular TV.  To get the benefits of lower input lag on any input you just enable the \"Game Mode\" setting in your general settings menu.  This will allow you to be able to also have your Movie mode setup appropriately even if the input is from your game console, just make sure Game Mode is turned off and that your picture mode is set to Movie.  Then when you want to play a game just flip on Game Mode.  I noticed on my set that they way over - sharpen the image out of the box.  I believe movie mode was set to like 50 and standard was set to like 20 out of the box or vice versa. If your input sources are good you will NEVER need your sharpening set to anything past 5 in my experience.  I keep sharpening off completely for any modes coming out of my PS4 and 5 sharpening for my standard mode which I use for cable TV.  Looks fantastic!!  One last note.  For the absolute best image quality make sure you set your picture size to \"screen fit\" which will ensure that you get perfect 1:1 pixel mapping from your sources.

I managed to walk out of there with the TV and 4 year warranty for the $1799 price. I was pretty stoked...until I got home. The ghosting on this TV was absolutely horrible! I returned the TV yesterday and was hesitant to bring home another fearing similar issues. Of course the Black Friday sale wasn't going on any longer but there are still a few TV's on sale. I noticed the UN55HU8000 on sale for $1899. Not a 4K but I really only went for the 4K based on the price. I managed to get the HU8000 at the exact deal I got on the HU7250 so I'm happy.  Now who has some killer settings!? "

		"description": "   I've had this tv for 10 days and I really like the picture. I find  have to adjust the picture settings here and there as there does not seem to be any standard when it comes to viewing.  I got the U65HN8000 for $1750, on Black Friday. It was listed at $2000 sale price on the web page, so I got a deal.  If it wasn't for that price, I probably would have taken it back and got a Vizio or something else far cheaper or the same price for something bigger. Its such a nice picture, I wish I could afford the next size up. 3D is pretty neat, but I doubt I'll use it that much. I bought Avatar 3D so I'm looking forward to watching.  Changing 2D to 3D is a snap and the effect is pretty good. Football is pretty wild watching in 3D. I get a little tired in the eyes and figure its something I will have to build up an endurance to I find the Samsung Smart Hub to be a joke. There are very few apps the average person would ever use. You cant do a search for them and you are limited to what Samsung posts.  Poor and little selection. The Face Book app is horrible. It doesn't look anything like any app I've seen before. I like the web browser and it is easy to use. Web pages look fantastic and easy to read The remote is neat, but I would rather have a keypad on it, not the one you have to point to on the tv and hope you can type fast enough. Lots of connections in the back and very easy to change the source with the remote. Sound is pretty good for such a thin tv. It sounds way better hung on the wall. All in all, the picture is great, but I don't think the average viewer would be upset with todays lesser priced TV's. I'd like to get a DVD and calibrate it properly. I've tried everyones different settings and have tweeked them a bit. Bottom line, if you get the tv for a good price, you will be happy.

Corner light bleed and flashlighting is something that's killed me on my 55W900 and on the 65X900Bs ive been looking at. The Cinema Black feature does an amazing job at keeping blacks pitch black on letter bars even in a pitch black room. Im shocked, I figured only OLED could cure this issue (plasma aside).  The local dimming is pretty crazy here as well, credits, in a pitch black room with smart led enabled, I barely see any light blooming whatsoever around the lettering, unlike the Sonys, and black levels overall are phenomenal (tested Prometheus, scenes set in space, star fields looked phenomenal considering this is edge lit).  Also, something minor, but with speakers set to audio out, there is no popup whatsoever when using my Samsung smart remote to control my external speaker.  Other than that, motion is on point, couldnt be happier with it, gaming performance on gaming mode is excellent, no noticeable lag.  This TV has it all. "

AA Before you jump ship try another 55H8000 as you are clearly not happy with this one. All of the problems you are describing, I see absolutely none of them on my 55 inch. The only picture setting I don't like is dynamic. The other three settings are perfectly ok with me. I have been happy with mine since the day I got it and still haven't tweaked any settings except changing to the movie setting.  As far as your washed out colors, it may be your cable feed. Remember this saying? Garbage in, garbage out. Well it is definitely true and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  I think you should ask Amazon for an exchange and give the 55H8000 another chance. If you still aren't happy then you'll know that you didn't give up easily.  "

What type of bias lighting are you looking at and are you considering it because of the h8000 or because you like bias lighting? "

		"description": "   Firmly decided to buy the H8000. I want a well rounded TV with a quality image for low lag gaming, movies, and 3D. This TV seems to be the best overall option. Need to decide if I should buy the 55\" at 2 grand or the 65\" at 2.7 grand for that enhanced home theater experience. I have to buy at PC Richards as I have some credit there. As it is for my bedroom I would be fine with either size, but I don't want to have that need to upgrade feeling later on. However the 65\" one is slightly pricey for me and I might just settle for a 55\" with an XBOX One. I already have the PS4 but I am a fan of the respective systems exclusives like Halo and The Last of Us. Buying the 65\" would put off the XBOX One purchase til Next year for sure, and I will be late to the party with Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Tough choice for me. "

A great collection for someone like me who likes Halo, dabbled in it, but never played half of them or played them to death. And I am looking forward to watching Blu-Rays in style like Captain America 2 in 3D, playing The Last of Us Remastered on a quality display bigger than 23 inches is going to be awesome. "

It's a TS01 Panel so I guess that's Samsung?  I'm confused about the setting for the PlayStation 4, WiiU and AppleTV though. should I just rename the source to PC or rename it to Game or set the Game Mode on via Settings &gt; General?

As for how the H8000  compares to the M70, the H8000 will trounce the Vizio in color  reproduction and picture video processing but it can be argued that the  M70 has a more effective dimming scheme and it's a much better value.  I'm hopeful Vizio with their FALD televisions will shame Samsung towards  offering such televisions at affordable prices next year because  frankly I think Samsung can do them a lot better.

		"description": "   I forgot to mention in my review: Glare on tv screen. I had the tv in my living room. To the right was a 5' glass door. I did not get much reflection from outside. I did get reflection from the lights in the room opposite the tv. This was very distracting. You could see a red ribbon across the top of the screen and sometimes a rainbow effect. Since then, I have wall mounted in a room with no windows. Fortunately, the light in that room is behind the tv and the main light is protected from view by a ceiling drop. Without any reflection on the screen, I get little to no glare. The walls are painted dark brown behind the tv and side walls are a bit lighter brown to help with a theatre setting. Hope to finish the room with Dolby Atmos        Quote:        Originally Posted by captaino      I've had this tv for 10 days and I really like the picture. I find  have to adjust the picture settings here and there as there does not seem to be any standard when it comes to viewing.  I got the U65HN8000 for $1750, on Black Friday. It was listed at $2000 sale price on the web page, so I got a deal.  If it wasn't for that price, I probably would have taken it back and got a Vizio or something else far cheaper or the same price for something bigger. Its such a nice picture, I wish I could afford the next size up. 3D is pretty neat, but I doubt I'll use it that much. I bought Avatar 3D so I'm looking forward to watching.  Changing 2D to 3D is a snap and the effect is pretty good. Football is pretty wild watching in 3D. I get a little tired in the eyes and figure its something I will have to build up an endurance to I find the Samsung Smart Hub to be a joke. There are very few apps the average person would ever use. You cant do a search for them and you are limited to what Samsung posts.  Poor and little selection. The Face Book app is horrible. It doesn't look anything like any app I've seen before. I like the web browser and it is easy to use. Web pages look fantastic and easy to read The remote is neat, but I would rather have a keypad on it, not the one you have to point to on the tv and hope you can type fast enough. Lots of connections in the back and very easy to change the source with the remote. Sound is pretty good for such a thin tv. It sounds way better hung on the wall. All in all, the picture is great, but I don't think the average viewer would be upset with todays lesser priced TV's. I'd like to get a DVD and calibrate it properly. I've tried everyones different settings and have tweeked them a bit. Bottom line, if you get the tv for a good price, you will be happy.        "

Standard is ok only if I bump the color from 50 to 70 but then everything is over saturated.  Natural is the best but it crushes blacks on video games.  Movie is not for me.  My 3 year old Samsung ccfl Lcd has an SQ01 Panel and the colors are spot on, vibrant,  and flesh tones are amazing.  The ES8000, which I had briefly, was a TS01 Panel and the picture was identical to my older Samsung.  Bad clouding was the reason I took it back.  Could see clearly during the day.       AA Before you jump ship try another 55H8000 as you are clearly not happy with this one. All of the problems you are describing, I see absolutely none of them on my 55 inch. The only picture setting I don't like is dynamic. The other three settings are perfectly ok with me. I have been happy with mine since the day I got it and still haven't tweaked any settings except changing to the movie setting.  As far as your washed out colors, it may be your cable feed. Remember this saying? Garbage in, garbage out. Well it is definitely true and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  I think you should ask Amazon for an exchange and give the 55H8000 another chance. If you still aren't happy then you'll know that you didn't give up easily.        I'm still debating.  I really don't want to give up the black levels and uniformity but the picture is driving me nuts.  I have a rule of thumb, if i have to fiddle with settings for more than 5 minutes to get a good picture then there's something wrong with the TV.  I've had at least 10 high end and mid range tvs over the last 8 years, a few got returned, and the ones I kept took me 2-4 minutes to realize if it was good or not. "

The monitor was a 1440p, mind you, versus a 1080p 32\" but seeing the great immersion it provided + some heavy AA and I totally forgot the 27\" monitor for good. Now I am readY to do the change from my beloved 32\" HDTV to a set just like yours, the 55\" H8000! "

A great collection for someone like me who likes Halo, dabbled in it, but never played half of them or played them to death. And I am looking forward to watching Blu-Rays in style like Captain America 2 in 3D, playing The Last of Us Remastered on a quality display bigger than 23 inches is going to be awesome.       Hi Neo,  I gave up watching TV about 14 years ago. Several years ago I decided to get a bluray player and watch movies on my 27\" 1080 computer monitor. Finally decided to go bigger and ended up getting the 55H8000. The viewing experience is completely different :-) If the H8000 has any flaws I don't notice them, I just enjoy the great, to me, picture  I'm not a gamer so I have no idea as to that side of things. Only thing connected to the set is my BP through a Denon AVR.  Stepping up from 23\" is huge! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do, and I believe many other owners of the set do also. "

The Cinema Black feature does an amazing job at keeping blacks pitch black on letter bars even in a pitch black room. Im shocked, I figured only OLED could cure this issue (plasma aside).  The local dimming is pretty crazy here as well, credits, in a pitch black room with smart led enabled, I barely see any light blooming whatsoever around the lettering, unlike the Sonys, and black levels overall are phenomenal (tested Prometheus, scenes set in space, star fields looked phenomenal considering this is edge lit).  Also, something minor, but with speakers set to audio out, there is no popup whatsoever when using my Samsung smart remote to control my external speaker.  Other than that, motion is on point, couldnt be happier with it, gaming performance on gaming mode is excellent, no noticeable lag.  This TV has it all.       I'm curious, have you watched any 4:3 content with side bars and if so how uniform do they look (I'll be happy to hear from anyone on this)?  I don't see how Cinema Black would have any effect on side bars.  The M series has no uniformity issues whatsoever and both the top and bottom bars look great but its poor video processing is a deal killer for me.  It sounds like blooming is less noticeable on the H8000 but probably at the cost of effective contrast.  The F8500 suits my needs the best but it's base design will not work in my bedroom. "

So far I'm finding the best picture is with the Natural mode, which I don't see many people suggesting. Just my opinion though. You can get standard to look pretty good, too. But there was an earlier post about the best settings in Movie mode from consumer reports or something and I thought it was bleh.  I just got a Yamaha YAS-93 sound bar. It's fantastic. The built in speakers were surprisingly good on the TV but this is just so much better. Got it at Costco for $190 ($230+ on Amazon).  Only question I have is that the TV only gives two options: PCM or DTS Neo 2:5. I have no idea which one to choose. Both seem to sound similar. I'm not audiophile so just wondering what you guys are using and what your thoughts are. "

		"description": "   I will try to remember tonight, if nobody else has answered.  At any rate, I have had this TV since shortly after it was released, in the form of the UN65H8000. The first panel I got had horrible light bleed in the lower left &amp; upper right corners. As many know, any light, including bleed, really rides the curve of the screen, creating faux-clouding. At any rate, I returned it &amp; the guy on the phone said he had a refused delivery that he could sell with full waranty as \"New; Opened Box\", for 50% off. Well, that was over a year ago &amp; that TDxx panel is darn near perfect. I really enjoy it &amp; while the curve doesn't do much for me  when it comes to movies &amp; TV, it is awesome while grinding away time on my PS4.  I think I will keep it in the media room for another year or two &amp; then look at the 75+ SUHD models. BTW, anyone considering picking one of these up, keep an eye out for deals from Paul's TV &amp; Appliance. They are an online retailer (big provider for Amazon) &amp; they also have brick &amp; mortar locations in Southern California. I have found them very helpful, honest &amp; reliable in my past dealings, going back over a decade.  Any way, as I was saying, this TV gives you a cool perspective when playing FPS games &amp; the brightness &amp; color are amazing. The video settings are pretty robust, so you can really dial in color, black, contrast &amp; brightness setting to your individual preference. I see a lot of people talk about certain calibration settings, but each panel will respond from slightly to extremely different to each setting. For me, I just start at the factory settings &amp; then use what changes were made in the calibration details in the forum, adjusting &amp; readjusting till they look good to my eyes, which is all that really matters in the end.

I am pretty sure i screwed up white balance settings since right now every value in sub menu is 128 and i am pretty sure it was different before. Even if panels are not comparable i still want to see maybe a possible tweaking window.  I love this tv, hooked up all consoles and pc and its amazing in game mode. Only complaint is that one of the recent firmware updates screwed up brightness setting for game mode but it was tweakable and not such a big pain. Please take some photos of service menu if you can. But remember if you even just enter service menu without changing anything it will reset all your picture settings from normal user interface. "

		"description": "   Hi guys! I bought  UE-H8000 TV a months ago and almost from the day 1 this TV started rebooting all the time while watching it. The auto power shut off is not enabled. It turns off then automatically turns right back on. It does this multiple times everyday and is not a factor of being on too long, as it has happened only 5 minutes after turning on or it may happen after 1 hour. The process takes about 30 seconds and doesn't require any work on my part but the tv is only 1 month old. The local Samsung official service could not resolve this issue. I have tried suggestions from the different internet forums and topics, including some settings in my Wi-Fi router, but it doesn't help. Does anyone have the same issue or know how to resolve it? "

		"description": "   Ok, so I think I'm the first person on here to purchase one of the Asian model numbers of this set. Mine is: UA65H8000 with a TS01 panel. TV looks beautiful, but I'm having trouble with the HDMI inputs. I have 3 sources I want to connect to it:  1) Set Top Box 2) Windows 7 PC 3) PlayStation 4  Set Top seems to be required to go into HDMI input 1. No problem. Works great.  The Windows PC works fine plugged into HDMI input 4. But plugging it in to inputs 2 or 3 results in the screen resolution dropping to only 640x480. Windows displays it as a generic display with no option to set the resolution correctly. But through HDMI input 4 all is well and normal.  The PS4 was originally plugged into HDMI input 2. I've heard others use this successfully. But when I plug it it, the picture is fine, but there is no sound. The same happens when I plug it into input 3. I tried everything to fix it, swapping out cables, switching inputs, trying different audio settings on the PS4, turning things on and off. Apparently there is an issue with the 2.0 firmware update on the PS4 sometimes causing there to be an issue with the audio output over HDMI.  However, if I plug the PS4 into HDMI input 4, then the sound returns and everything works fine! Of course the problem now is that if I want to switch from the PC to the Playstation, I have to manually unplug and replug the HDMI cables. I had assumed that an HDMI input is basically and HDMI input and they they were relatively standard and interchangeable. There was no issue on my 5 year old LG TV this Samsung replaced.  So... any workarounds or suggestions for how I could get both the Playstation and Windows PC both plugged into the TV and functioning correctly? "

Thanks guys, please respond ASAP if possible.       I've had the UN65H8000 TV over a month and I really love it. I was exactly in the same boat before purchase. I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn't disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn't make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don't even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven't tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn't much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that's why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( &gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money. "

It's not my cables or my setup because I have an older TV currently in our living room with the same cables and setup and it looks great.  I'm going to get either the 55h7150 or the 55h6400 in the next few days.  I've heard the h7150 has bad flashlighting but the 55\" seems to be the best in uniformity.  The h6400 is mainly a failsafe if the 7150 doesn't work out.  Thanks for all the info over the last 6 months.       AA Sorry it didn't work out for you. I guess that's why they call it the panel lottery. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you don't. I hope whichever you decide on(7150 or 6400)works out for the best.  Good luck  "

I can deal with lighter black levels or uneven uniformity but a dull/lifeless/faded picture will get sent back every time.  I understand the limitations of \"LCD\" TVs.  Plasma sucks, IMO.  TVs, just like color, beauty, music, movies, and food are subjective.  What's good for you is not good for me and vice versa.  I'm glad you've found your perfect set.  I have one that's perfect but it's a 46\" and I need one that's 55\" for our living room.  Didn't one of you return your set for minor clouding/flashlighting?   You knew the limitations so why did you exchange it?  You were after that perfect set and it appears you got it. "

I think the blacks are pretty good and there my be a bit of black crush at times but such events pass by and I really don't know how much if any details were lost. Honest officer, it was too dark to see anything.  I did, early on, reduce the backlight level to 10, IIRC, based on comments here...  I recall, either here, or one of the other threads I've been reading that for the fault finders once they search and find something then they can't \"unsee\" it (to paraphrase whatever they actually wrote). So I sit back and relax, watch, and enjoy the movie.  I hope some of the more expert folks can give you a better answer. "

Most channels are fine and it's really only American Dad that seems washed out but only when there's a predominantly WHITE background.  I did have to push the COLOR Setting up to 60.  Everything else is at it's default setting other than Cinema Black (high), Dynamic Contrast (low), and Smart LED (high).  Picture Setting is on Standard. "

I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn't disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn't make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don't even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven't tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn't much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that's why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( &gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money.       You had me fully convinced to get the H8000 but then you said the hu8550 at the very end lol. I tried the hu8550 already and it had ghosting issues and audio sync problems. I don't know if I just had a bad hu8550 or if this problem will persist. Everything else was really nice on the TV though. SO basically it is ust down to the hu8550 and the H8000. It also sucks to buy a TV right now because I know Samsung will be releasing new TVs in late March I was told. "

I'm trying to get the most out of the settings and, even if it's a fairly new tv, I haven't got much help from the internet in terms of calibrations. I'm using the tv as a pc monitor and learned it's a good idea to rename HDMI to PC, I did it, but find the image is kind of lacking in something I can't put my finger on. It looks blurrier than before?  I know all tv:s should be treated individually, but does anyone of you know the best settings for pc mode, game mode (both on pc and ps3) and movie mode for this particular model? I'm currently using pc mode for browsing the internet, but when it comes to watching videos or movies there must be a better way, should I always switch to movie mode when I open a video on youtube for example?  Bear with me, I'm really new with these kinds of tv:s. Any help would be appreciated! "

They also have free shipping and a 60 money  back guarantee. You also get lifetime technical support at no extra cost. I have bought 4 televisions from them and every one arrived in perfect condition. They use UPS freight for shipping.  Depending on where you live, shipping takes 2 to 3 days. Visit their site and call them. You can place your order over the phone which is the way I ordered mine. They are a first class operation and will answer any questions you might have. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.  "

I switched off of the ARC HDMI input and hooked up the TV to the receiver with an optical cable thinking it was ARC triggering my receiver to switch inputs.   Even after doing this is STILL switches inputs when I turn the TV on.  The only way to get it to stop is to disable Anynet+ completely but that obviously kills all of the convenience of it as well.   Also when disabled there's no TV Speaker \"off\" option that I can find?  I just have to turn the volume all the way down?   Stupid.......  Anyone have any better luck with this than me?  On a weird side note when Anynet+ is on my receiver shows the input signal is Dolby Digital but when it's off its PCM?  I have my Xfinity box set to \"surround\"?

		"description": "   I've read this post from page 1 to the last one and I don't seem to recall much love for a HDTV! I watch movies with my projector but I use my HDTV (32\" Samsung 32F6300) on a daily basis to play video games (both with my PC and my PS4) and to watch movies when I don't want to use my home theater. Since I actually enjoy both activities (video games &amp; movie watching) I've been thinking about the possibility to upgrade my TV and went looking for the LG 55\" 4K OLED TV. The cons I read were enough to put me away for paying that much for a non \"perfect\" TV for my uses and then I read about the 55\" UN55H8000 HDTV.  I have some quick questions for the owners of this HDTV that I would be very grateful if you gave me your insight:  1. I've seen that many people here play video games with the 55H8000 and they talk about the immersive feeling the curved display gives. If I don't notice any lag whatsoever with my 32\" Samsung 32F6300 when playing video games to the point that I don't even use the GAME MODE, should I be fine with the 55H8000? (I play mostly games like GTA 5, Watch Dogs, COD and driving games like Grid 2). I plan to use the 55H8000 on the same room I have the 32\" and seat reasonably closer like 5.4 - 6 foot to play video games.  2. Being that my TV is said 32\" Samsung 32F6300 (that's the 6000 series) would I get a best picture quality with the 55H8000 when watching movies? By better I mean better colors rendition, better blacks and contrast and overall and improvement so I could notice the difference from my former TV?  3. For \"just\" about $300 more I could get the 55\" 4K Samsung HU8700 TV or even pay less for the 4K HU7250 TV. I know 4K it's supposed to be \"better\" BUT if ALL my content will be at 1080p because I don't forth see a lot of 4K content in both video games and movies in the next 2-3 years, if I were to play said 1080p content on any of those 4K TV would I get the same or better image of the H8000 TV? Is it true the 4K TVs produces more input lag than a 1080p? I read some place that a 4K TV actually UPSCALES the 1080p content to an almost 4K content so if that it's true the 4K TV would be a no brainer...  4. Last question: Amazon.com is selling the UN55H8000 at US$1997,99. Do you think this price could go lower at Black Friday? Being that this HDTV seems to be a very popular model I wouldn't like to wait until Black Friday to see if the price can go lower and then realize that not only did the price didn't went low but that the TV went into unavailability.  Thank you a lot for your help! Much appreciated!      "

Is the Audio Out 5.1? My current Samsung only outputs audio in stereo. Also, can you use the split screen with two HDMI sources (or is it only for the built in apps)?  Thanks "

I watch movies with my projector but I use my HDTV (32\" Samsung 32F6300) on a daily basis to play video games (both with my PC and my PS4) and to watch movies when I don't want to use my home theater. Since I actually enjoy both activities (video games &amp; movie watching) I've been thinking about the possibility to upgrade my TV and went looking for the LG 55\" 4K OLED TV. The cons I read were enough to put me away for paying that much for a non \"perfect\" TV for my uses and then I read about the 55\" UN55H8000 HDTV.  I have some quick questions for the owners of this HDTV that I would be very grateful if you gave me your insight:  1. I've seen that many people here play video games with the 55H8000 and they talk about the immersive feeling the curved display gives. If I don't notice any lag whatsoever with my 32\" Samsung 32F6300 when playing video games to the point that I don't even use the GAME MODE, should I be fine with the 55H8000? (I play mostly games like GTA 5, Watch Dogs, COD and driving games like Grid 2). I plan to use the 55H8000 on the same room I have the 32\" and seat reasonably closer like 5.4 - 6 foot to play video games.  2. Being that my TV is said 32\" Samsung 32F6300 (that's the 6000 series) would I get a best picture quality with the 55H8000 when watching movies? By better I mean better colors rendition, better blacks and contrast and overall and improvement so I could notice the difference from my former TV?  3. For \"just\" about $300 more I could get the 55\" 4K Samsung HU8700 TV or even pay less for the 4K HU7250 TV. I know 4K it's supposed to be \"better\" BUT if ALL my content will be at 1080p because I don't forth see a lot of 4K content in both video games and movies in the next 2-3 years, if I were to play said 1080p content on any of those 4K TV would I get the same or better image of the H8000 TV? Is it true the 4K TVs produces more input lag than a 1080p? I read some place that a 4K TV actually UPSCALES the 1080p content to an almost 4K content so if that it's true the 4K TV would be a no brainer...  4. Last question: Amazon.com is selling the UN55H8000 at US$1997,99. Do you think this price could go lower at Black Friday? Being that this HDTV seems to be a very popular model I wouldn't like to wait until Black Friday to see if the price can go lower and then realize that not only did the price didn't went low but that the TV went into unavailability.  Thank you a lot for your help! Much appreciated!        Do yourself a big favor and buy the H8000 Samsung. You definitely will not regret it.  Also I think 4k tv is still a few years away from being a worthwhile purchase. "

		"description": "   Ok, I am almost reading to buy the UN55H8000 HDTV and I am way to excited! Just to quick questions: I read a review saying that even though the 55H8000 is a great TV, you could get the same results with the lower price Samsung H7150 even though I have make a specs comparison between those 2 models and the H8000 was Micro Dimming Ultimate and the H7150 has Micro Dimming Pro and the H8000 has CMR of 1200 and the H7150 of 960 and I like the curved model because I will use these TV (the H8000) only for myself for playing video games and watching some movies that my family don't like so I can be seated near and at the perfect center. So does buying the H8000 over the H7150 makes sense?  The second and last question is in comparison with the 55\" HU8700 &amp; HU8550 because I read a review saying that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal those 4K TVs is quite good and you can see every detail but on the other hand I have read other reviews and post saying that the upscaling a 4K TV does degrades or makes blurry the 1080p image and introduceds lag. The H8000 has the better ms response rate in gaming and said 4K models are worst but if it could be true that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal actually creates a better looking image the H8000 would provide it could make some sense to buy the 4K model.  What do you think? Thank you!!! "

Almost all clouding and flashlighting is caused by overtightening of the screws that secure the panel.  This tech probably could have got your existing panel looking good by loosening and retightening the panel screws to the proper spec all the way around.  Sounds like he did a good job installing the new panel.  If you have any residual clouding you can probably massage it out with a microfiber cloth.  Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk "

Several decades ago I started wearing progressive lenses in my glasses and I know some folks couldn't get comfortable with them... what I noticed was that they introduced a curve, similar to what I see on my H8000. Fortunately the progressive lenses didn't bother me and I'm fine with the curve on my Samsung but maybe some folks just won't feel comfortable with the curve. No right or wrong or which is best except for each individual, IMO. It does have processing that increases contrast(?) on objects determined to be closer to the viewer adding a sense of depth and this kinda pulls me into the picture. YVMV  I was looking at the 55H7150 at first and after seeing the 55H8000 I kept coming back to it so I finally decided to go with it, fortunately I'm quite happy with my choice. If its easy to return then that makes taking a chance a bit easier... I suspect either one would have been okay because I wouldn't be comparing them continually  I mostly just enjoy the picture and as someone else posted, don't recall if it was on this thread, once they found a problem they couldn't not see it. So if its not readily noticable I'll enjoy the picture. I did lower the backlight to around 10 which seemed better for me.  And while I have the 55H8000 I noticed with my latest prescription the magnification factor is such that I see an image roughly a foot wider... so I get a ~ a 65+\" view for the price of the 55\" model "

Since my 55H8000 looks like a 65+\" set to me, I can understand wanting a larger screen, it does make a difference IMO. I enjoyed watching my brothers 47\" Samsung during visits but I knew if I bought one I wanted at least a 55\". I sit about 8' from the screen and wouldn't want it any smaller.  As with the review you mention from England, it seems most of us on the thread are happy with the 55H8000.  I doubt I qualify as an audiophile or videophile  As noted before I am enjoying the picture and the sound, especially with the added subwoofer but I am looking forward to getting the 4520CI powered up as the surround element is missing. Hope to start on running speaker wires in the next couple of days.  All the best, "

This issue is very regular, so i suspect a firmware bug (the last 1141 is already instelled), but i'm not very sure and could be my tv set defective also. I already done a tv reset Someone found  the same problem? Or someone can try to use component input?  Thanks a lot       I do some other tests and this issue involves all the analog input: AV input and RGB input. So if some other owner can test this can confirm if this issue is not only for me Thanks "

		"description": "     My son plays with a PS3 and a PS4;  he says that there is a noticeable difference when using game mode. Maybe as much as a 1/2 second difference.  Just his thoughts, not measured at all. The PS4 must be turned on to be recognized before game mode can be selected. The PS4 is in HDMI 2.  We received the 48 inch version of the TV yesterday. So too early for a considered evaluation.  But, initial thoughts are very positive. I have scoured this forum for a couple of weeks. I had never heard of all the things that can go wrong with an LED screen. Clouding, flashlighting,  light bleed, banding, oh my!!!!  From what I have seen so far and after looking for it with a black screen at night and dark scenes at night, I have panel TS01 and I have not seen any such issues yet.  I went from my CRT Sony Trinitron Wega 1080i 36 inch. I loved that tv. But, after 8 years it died.  I planned to get a Sony as I have only had a Sony for over thirty years. My husband is still watching and enjoying a 2003 Sony XBR LCD!  But, after much research reading reviews and this forum, I decided on this Samsung H8000.    It made the list of 10 best televisions in the world as did a couple of Sony televisions.  Right out of the box, the picture is crisp, no motion issues,  colors are great, skin tones look natural, and the black levels are very dark with no light bleed at all. Right out of the box in standard picture mode, it is almost perfect for me. We tweaked the settings very slightly in standard mode.  I put sound on clear voice mode.  The only trouble I am having at all is voice recognition when trying to use voice interaction.  I was actually sad to not get a Sony, seriously almost 1/2 my life with a Sony tv!!!  But, this tv is amazing to me and is far superior in picture quality to my 2006 CRT. And, to the 2003 Sony XBR, granted that Sony is an older tv. "

Nearly all of you who own either the 55\" or the 65\" are reporting great uniformity, very little clouding/flashlighting and very good black levels. It doesn't seem to matter which panel(tdxx/tsxx) you have as both seem to be pretty good.  There has been some complaints pertaining to input lag, but I'm assuming it has to do with gaming. I'm not a gamer so that wouldn't bother me. I don't care about 3d either.  The only Samsung tv I've had was the UN46B8500 full array local dimming. Alas that tv developed a panel problem(vertical multi-colored lines on half of the panel). I had it repaired under warranty but it was never the same . That was in 2011 and I've stayed away from Samsung since  The only other brand I've owned is Sony(kdl46nx720 still going strong). I recently bought an xbr55x850b 4k Sony in early July and returned it after a week because of horrible clouding/flashlighting. A replacement was sent and two weeks later it was also returned for the same issues(refund).  I would like to say that because of all of the positive responses concerning the H8000 I strongly believe that i'm going to give Samsung another shot. My preferred place of purchase is Crutchfield. If the Sammy doesn't work out they have a 60 day money back guarantee.  Wish me luck  "

It's not the TV I have a PN60E 8000 and an Onkyo TX-NR 818 it does the same thing. I also have a PN51F5500 and a TX-NR 737 it does the same thing. When ever you come out of sleep and power everything up both receivers input goes the tv/cd I have tried everything it's just the evils of ARC "

At $1884, it's still over $700 cheaper than most other places. My viewing distance is 8' so initially I wanted a 55\" but the 65\" is actually cheaper right now. I'm worried about the picture quality at 8' away. Does anyone else sit relatively close to their 65\"?  BTW, it looks like Best Buys are getting rid of their display models so you might be able to pick up an open box one. I saw one for $2398. "

A question? If you weren't satisfied why didn't you just contact the place of purchase and request an exchange. If it were me, I would have demanded an exchange and not even messed around with a panel change. "

		"description": "   Okay, just got my new UN65H800! Quite happy with it so far, but noticeable black uniformity issues unless Smart LED is turned on.  I run my blu ray player and my PC through my Denon receiver, through HDMI to the TV. When I name this source \"PC\" then switch sources on the receiver from actual PC to blu ray, the TV somehow knows these inputs are different and will save different picture settings for each. This is nice, and would be perfect if PC mode allowed Smart LED to be activated. I use my PC for games, and the flashlighting turns up more in games than it does in movies it seems (loading screens, etc.).  Otherwise, if I name that source on the TV \"game\" or \"AV Receiver\", whatever picture settings I set are global for that TV source, regardless if I change the Denon's source. This is annoying since I'd want to use something like game mode, and different sharpness settings for when the Denon's source is my PC vs movie settings for when the Denon's source is my blu ray.  Any ideas? "

As with the review you mention from England, it seems most of us on the thread are happy with the 55H8000.  I doubt I qualify as an audiophile or videophile  As noted before I am enjoying the picture and the sound, especially with the added subwoofer but I am looking forward to getting the 4520CI powered up as the surround element is missing. Hope to start on running speaker wires in the next couple of days.  All the best,       Hi Ken The biggest tv I've ever had is 46\". I bought a 55\" Sony x850b but it was returned due to panel problems. The day I returned it I set up the 46\" and immediately noticed the difference between 46\" and 55\". The 55\" was much easier on my 68 year old eyes.  I'm going to get the un55h8000 and the 46\" Sony will be relegated to bedroom duties.  BTW, I too am retired. "

While I like the added pixel and what the future may hold for 4k I can't help but feel the H8000 is the way to go since 90% percent of usage will be PS4 gaming. I love the curve and the price for the 55\" of both models fall well in line with one another, so make the leap or stick with flagship 1080p.

On the back of my panel the sticker says something about Samsung America NJ , but then it says it was distribute by Samsung Canada. I dont know if the model I got is a Canadian version or American one. I got this panel as a replacement for my f8000 by Samsung. Does the sticker at the back of your tv say the same? "

As stated by others, bright scenes look great however as soon as a dark scene (The Last of Us) is displayed, auto dimming goes crazy and makes it hard to see anything.  My old set, I was able to adjust the white balance by lowering it and turning up the brightness setting, thus passing the auto dimming threshold and tricking the set into thinking the brightness did not require auto dimming.  Has anyone figure out how to trick this model yet?  Cheers. "

Oh well.       The $4k was for the LG OLED that's 55''.  I read some recent news about burn-in though.  I'm not in the mood to spend that much and then baby it.  Are you referring to auto dimming or local?  Auto dimming will dim the entire picture on darker scenes to give the effect of deeper blacks.  There's usually no setting to change if your TV is equipped with it.  Local Dimming dims just the darker sections, or zones, of the picture, leaving the rest of the scene alone.  It's usually referred to as Smart LED on Samsung Sets and there's a high/low setting.   Anyone with a 65\" H8000 have a TS01 Panel or are they only TD01 Panels?  Do the H8000 Owners with clouding/uniformity problems have U.S. Versions with Local Dimming activated or is it just bad luck? "

I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don't have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000's must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask!       Just the post I was looking for.  I'm looking to upgrade from my LN52A860 (the set that made me fall in love with Samsungs)  but I've been torn after looking at articles on the top gaming TVs.  I really don't want to go back to a Sony. I have no idea what the input lag is on my LN52A860 but I was hoping to improve on it. There is no game mode on the LN52A860 (that I know of). It looks like the only real option from 2014 Samsung models is the H800s. I'm torn between the 55\" or 65\" but my main concern is if the 34-37ms lag is still going to be noticeable. I couldn't find any info on how the LN52A860 rated with input lag so I don't really have any comparison. My other question is how does turning on game mode effect the picture quality? "

		"description": "   I got mine about 7 days ago.  Its the US version.  Its a TD02.   I like the TV, but then I also don't like it.  I was VERY leary about getting a SAMSUNG..I have Panasonic Plasma (that I love) &amp; an older Mitshubishi LCD.  I LOVE the 3D on this.  I LOVE the SMARTness and the apps.   I think the picture is good, but Damn it needs a real tune (mine is in the basement and its darker down there...LOL).  I do have setting that I can live with.   I have tried many tunes.  I have tried some in this thread.  I think its best to use the \"auto\" setting for the 10-point.  Bottom line for me is that my AVR equipment is not playing friendly with it (that bugs the living crap out of me).   Samsung must HATE Pioneer or vice-versa.  To me it's a travesty that this TV wants to force the use of an optical connection to my SC-72 (SC-72 is a 2013 receiver and an awesome one at that).  I have switched the receiver to allow ARC...I have played with the DVI HDMI input and other video conversion settings on my receiver and this TV just will not support true HDMI discovery/ARC with my Pioneer.  I will NOT use an Optical cable to make it happy.  Instead I have to move the input manually to get them all to \"play nice in the sand box\".   My Panasonic sure had no issues with Pioneer!!!   I am on the fence about taking this back...I like the TV.  My Pioneer BDP-62FD Blu-Ray gets detected by the TV and will auto switch to the proper input, but its slow and you see the stupid on-screen msg about the source not present (that's crap and SLOW!).  Also when watching a BD the 16:9 black bars sometimes go in and out between \"full screen\" while playing the same movie.  I want \"full\" not black bars.  Cant seem to get that sorted even with the SmartBD option turned off.   Basically, I will be calling Pioneer, but I think it's the TV.  If I have to hook up an optical just to get the units to talk outside of pure HDMI then I say \"F\" this TV!!!  I surely value my Pioneer elite AVR better than the TV!   I have all HDMI 2.0 high end cables.   BTW: If you want to reset this TV back to \"out of box settings\" then you need the PIN number.  I called Samsung last night.  the PIN is 0000 (4 zeros).   If I can get the thing to like Pioneer then I am keeping it...it is a nice picture when It wants to be.  I still want real tune settings for a dark room however,   Sorry for the long read, but please someone \"help\" me with the Pioneer stuff and I will love this TV.   I also have a PS4 and it works with Game mode on or off, but Game mode seems better. "

		"description": "   I am guessing (hoping) Pioneer can help.  If I try to use true ARC and hook Verizon, PS4, and BD to TV, then take TV to SC-72 I would only get Dolby 5.1 from Apps and get 2.0 from PCM(also would require optical as well) instead of full 7.1 HD sound with one HDMI.  I realize I can switch receiver to an input and get both via an HDMI, but TV wont allow it automatically without conversion that will create input-lag that will make video and audio suffer for different things(IE: video lag to great for games &amp; Audio would not be HD to allow for proper streamed video).  I also still have no idea how to make the Input on this H8000 be PC???  Does anyone know if I can use the Receiver's 2 separate HDMI \"outputs\" go to TV instead of TV to AVR \"Inputs\"?  That way I would have audio and video HDMI split?  I am not a pro here by any means. "

I can comfortably watch from the kitchen which puts me at about a 40* angle.  You can tell that the picture is lighter but it's not distracting, not to me at least.

Is it something that would give me fits watching Harry Potter, (a lot of dark scenes), in the dark with no lights? "

There's not a wide variety of panels with the h8000.  65\" has TD01/02 and 55\"/ 46\" have TS01/02.  I've been looking at the 65\" for a while now but keep hearing about slight uniformity issues.  I'm seriously considering the LG55EC9300 OLED that recently came out but really scared of Burn-in/Image Retention. "

		"description": "   My current panel is a TD02 with an Aug 2014 mfg date for what it's worth.   Interested to see what the next one will be  I feel like the lower right portion of my panel was just slightly over tightened.  I bet if it were backed off a quarter turn it would be perfect.  If the new one isn't any better I'll place a call to samsung and see if they are willing to send out a technician to try and adjust the panel or replace it until we get one that's suitable.   I was looking at the LG OLED as well but the first amazon review scared me a bit with the bad motion judder under certain situations.  Granted this could probably be fixed with a firmware update but....... ya never know.   I wouldn't be so much worried about IR as it doesn't seem to be an issue.  I'm a long time plasma advocate and if that was manageable I'm sure OLED is even better.   If it were 65\" I'd be all over it.  I'm coming from a 55 and really wanted 65 or larger which I why I was sold on the H8000.   If it weren't for some QC issues I have read about on the F8500 it would have been the clear choice for me.

		"description": "   My 55H8000 arrived today, panel version TS02. I have not noticed any flashlighting/clouding at all. The picture is superb and I haven't even touched the settings yet. The sound is actually quite good although it will benefit greatly from a soundbar/subwoofer system. Standard definition programming through dish network is the best I've ever seen. High definition is out of this world as is blu-ray.  Regarding the curved screen, it took me all of two minutes getting used to it. The curve is very subtle and does provide slightly better off angle viewing. The curvature of the stand is greater than that of the tv itself so it's my thinking that it makes getting used to the curved screen easier.  I'll tinker with the settings over the next few days, but right now I'm going to sit back and enjoy this wonderful tv.  To say I'm happy would be an understatement Well done Samsung. "

I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy. "

The 7150 base would have been too wide for my stand which would have required the purchase of a new stand. The 8000 fit on the one I already had which allowed me to put that money into the TV instead of having to buy a new stand or pay to have it mounted (That's the way I rationalized it out anyway). "

		"description": "   Hi All,  I've only ever had Sony's and most recently bought a 65\" X9 4k. The set is amazing in every regard EXCEPT motion resolution. It's ok for tv and films but awful for video games. I suspect this is a combination of high lcd latency and upscaling. Game mode has low input lag but the motion blur is terrible when playing FPS'. I play with interpolation turned on and it helps a good bit but it's still pretty bad, especially on 30fps games, and lag is way up.  So, I'm selling the TV, which is heartbreaking. I use my tv primarily for games and can't deal with the blur. My sony from 2010 was much better in terms of motion but the picture was obviously not nearly as good. I'm seriously considering the Samsung h8000 because my understanding is that Samsung's in general have better motion handling and this particular set is best.  My question is for gamers. What is the motion blur like in game mode and have you played with AMP on? Is it better with a tolerable latency? I don't play competitively so even 100ms doesn't bother me. But motion blur kills the experience. Many gamers said they thought the x9 was great for gaming, but clearly they're not sensitive to blur. I'd love to get some candid responses regarding motion blur and gaming on this set. Thanks!  Jason "

Burn in just isn't going to happen. Ever. One of the reasons plasmas are going off of the market is due to the burn in resistance of LCDs. And there is nothing different about the Samsung panel that makes it more susceptible.  Trust me, don't think twice about it. I've had lcd monitors playing the same content on loops for years on end without issue (demo material). And if it were an issue, there would be no tv on the market that anyone could buy.  It's entirely possible that language is just a hold over from the manual the company did for their plasma and no-one thought to take it out. "

If the new one isn't any better I'll place a call to samsung and see if they are willing to send out a technician to try and adjust the panel or replace it until we get one that's suitable.   I was looking at the LG OLED as well but the first amazon review scared me a bit with the bad motion judder under certain situations.  Granted this could probably be fixed with a firmware update but....... ya never know.   I wouldn't be so much worried about IR as it doesn't seem to be an issue.  I'm a long time plasma advocate and if that was manageable I'm sure OLED is even better.   If it were 65\" I'd be all over it.  I'm coming from a 55 and really wanted 65 or larger which I why I was sold on the H8000.   If it weren't for some QC issues I have read about on the F8500 it would have been the clear choice for me. Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk       Did the Flashlighting go away at all with Local Dimming on High?  The LG OLED, (9300), just got a firmware update that supposedly fixed the motion issues.  But, the issues were mainly with owners not activating the Tru-Motion, or whatever LG calls their motion settings, while watching blu rays with a 24/1080p film cadence.  Once turned on, there were no issues but obviously introduced Soap Opera Effect.  New update fixed it. "

The dimming definitely helps hide the problem but like stated earlier I'd rather not have to mask an obvious issue.  Sounds like the LG is a contender for sure then!  Wish I could see one in person somewhere.  I bet it looks amazing.  OLED is definitely the future of televisions.  Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk "

After reading lots of posts here I did go in thinking I'd probably buy the 55H7150 but watching both for a while pushed me to the 8000 even at an additional $400.  When I told the sales rep at Best Buy that I wanted a Samsung panel he had no idea that some sets didn't use Samsung panels, nor did the guy that delivered and set it up. Happily it came with a TS02.  I've been without a TV for 14 years and finally recycled the massive, 225 pound Sony monitor, and old electronics to make way for a new setup. I only watch DVDs and Blu-Ray movies on it. Love the picture. I did turn the backlight down to 10.  I think the sound on the set is pretty good for a TV but it is weak in the low end, no shaking the walls. I remembered that my BD player has audio out jacks and one of them is a sub-woofer output so i plugged in my Velodyne sub-woofer built in 1991. Much nicer. I had to put a new foam surround on it as it self destructed on my first movie, Ender's Game. The foam was rotted. Found a repair kit at a company in Southern California. Cost $40 with tax and postage. Sounds great.  Looking to get a Marantz NR1605 for the time being, as the budget is a bit tight after the cost of the TV ;-) "

Hopefully, I made a wise choice. The Bu-ray arrives later in the week.   You should be good with that blu-ray player. Right now I have the Panasonic DMP-BDT500, but might need to replace it soon as I'm starting to get strange artifacts on the right side of my screen on certain movies. Thought at first it was the movies, but tried a friends player and didn't get it. Let me know how you like the Sammy blu-ray player. Might look into that one myself. Let me know how well it handels 3D as well, as that is something I do like and one of the reasons I went with the bd-t500.       Hi Joseph,  This is a late reply but I just recently signed on with AVS Forums.  I watched Prometheus in 3D on my BD-F7500 and thought it did pretty well. The glasses bother some folks eyes or cause headaches but I did alright. I remember 3D movies in the 1950s and never had a problem with them either.  I also tried the 2D &gt; 3D option and it added a bit of depth but not as much as a 3D disk.  The glasses are a bit like sunglasses and make the picture darker which I  don't care for. "

After reading most of the H7150 posts it seems it's hit or miss with uniformity problems.  Even among Samsung Panels, (TS01/TH01).  I think a lot of the 7150 owners who claim their set is relatively blemish free are not sure what uniformity is or aren't obsessing over it because there are quite a few reports of Flashlighting and clouding on the S-PVA Panels.       I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy.       How is the Flashlighting on the 8000 in a dark room? "

The Bad: It doesn't have as deep a black level as a plasma; it suffers from a slight red push; it has a reflective screen; Yahoo apps aren't very slick; and the remote sensor isn't very responsive. The Bottom Line: The Vizio M-Series offers a potent combination of excellent design, decent picture quality, and a pocket-friendly price.'  You get what you pay for.  If your satisfied with a little less picture quality and apps, a little lower quality of the passive 3D image, a picture that doesn't pop like it's cheaper E-Series TV, then you are welcome to buy a lower quality set.  Good picture, but not better than a Samsung. "

I am amped for the P-series Vizio right now, but share the same concerns with Vizio use of the term full array. I have owned the HX929 from Sony and that was a hell of a set. While H8000 is an edge based dimmer, samsung has a rather impressive implementation. I am optimistic for the P-series, but will likely end up with the H8000 @ 1080p or the HU7250 (curved) or HU8550 (flat)@ 4k. "

If i connect a devices like bd / ps3 / setup box tv/  and play this, i have for about a second, an audio drop out (the picture instead is perfect), about 7 minutes from the time to tv is switched on and then, the same thing for every 3 minutes and 30-35 seconds. This issue is very regular, so i suspect a firmware bug (the last 1141 is already instelled), but i'm not very sure and could be my tv set defective also. I already done a tv reset Someone found  the same problem? Or someone can try to use component input?  Thanks a lot "

		"description": "   Good day everyone,  I purchased the 65H8000 this past weekend mainly for games. I was worried about the input lag. I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don't have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000's must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask! "

You can't set it at any level, it's automatically on and there is NO level to control.  Subsequently, the US version has no option to control it either ( at least not in the entire manual )  So for all the Canadian customers, no one was left out, we do have it and on ALL screen sizes.  for the UK people, I would call to confirm if it's available.

Realistic ultra-clean, high quality, low noise images, excellent flesh tones, excellent detail, saturated color, deep inky black in every scene.  I believed (imagined otherwise) that both shows as listed looked as if the H8000 was monitoring at the show set live in the control booth. Both broadcast looked exceptional, reference quality.   HD OTA antenna: Channel Master CM 4220 HD, this is newest version of what was installed at my site. Cable 100ft direct RG6 18 AWG, quad shield, direct to H8000 from antenna, nothing in between but terminated cable connectors. "

Samsung seem to be the only company this year to have released an actual flagship 1080p set and Im curious how it stacks up, as it seemingly has essentially every single feature from the 9000, except \"purcolor\" and a drop from 1400 to 1200 MCR (though the 8000 has a 240hz native panel...) Putting aside 4k content, I wonder how the two would stack up when playing 1080p content... "

But, apparently this television is different than the usual, and people are enjoying the new purchase. If this is true then this TV is worth the steep price tag. How difficult is it to place the stand assembly onto the set out of the box? I'm guessing that with the curved screen, extra care must be taken when laying it down to prevent damage. Or do you simply set the television down onto the stand upright, like the way Panny plasmas are stand mounted? Thanks guys congrats on your new sets. I have a Mits DLP that is starting to show signs of chip failure (specks/spots visible during dark scenes or when screen is blank/no input) so the 65 is looking like a prime replacement. Of course it's cheaper to fix, but 10,000:1 contrast ratio is a little passe these days. "

For those that had no issues even with it turned off I guess it may have been luck of the draw. I know I was pretty unlucky with my first 60in 7100 and 2 Sony 850As. But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.  \u00a0 So we're on the same page: Smart LED feature == \"Precision Black\" == local dimming Micro Dimming Ultimate == software-based video processing. It's not really local dimming of the LEDs at all. \u00a0 The US versions\u00a0of the\u00a0F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate as well as\u00a0Precision Black local dimming. The UK and\u00a0Canadian versions of the F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate, but NOT Precision Black local dimming. \u00a0 The UK version of the H8000 that was reviewed has no hardware-based local dimming. It's an actual difference in the hardware, not just software. To make things more confusing, the Canadian H8000 webpage says \"Precision Black (Local Dimming) Available\". So there's probably two different versions of the TV in Canada. \u00a0 That\u00a0AVForums H8000 review\u00a0is a bit confusing: \"The also H8000 doesn't include Samsung's Smart LED feature which is a shame because it really helps with the perceived blacks but its absence is consistent with last year's F8000 model. However the local dimming was very effective, expertly handling our usual assortment of torture tests.\"\u00a0They seem\u00a0to imply that the UK H8000 they tested has local dimming, which it doesn't. I'm guessing they were actually referring to F8000 and the fact that its local dimming is effective. \u00a0 FWIW, my Canadian UN55F8000, which has no local dimming, has no issues with uniformity.  "

		"description": "   Regarding your question about gaming mode on the H8000. The review on avforums indicated:\u201cThe H8000 delivered a sizeable input lag of 120ms when in the calibrated Movie mode but thankfully things improved dramatically when the Game mode was selected. This brought the input lag down to 34ms which whilst not the lowest we've measured - Sony appear to be the leaders in this area at the moment - should be low enough for all but the most demanding of gamers. Unlike the HU8500, renaming the input didn't make any difference to the lag but 34ms is amongst the best we have measured recently. Certainly we didn't notice any appreciable delay when gaming on the H8000 and overall we found it to be quite responsive, although our reactions might not be as cat-like as many others. If you sat quite close to the display, the curved nature of the screen could also help to make the gaming experience slightly more immersive\u201d. This review indicated the input lag in Gaming mode is identical to that specified in the avforums review:\"Samsung has reduced the input lag on the 55H8000 compared with last year\u2019s 55F8000, though it\u2019s still behind the class-leading Sony Bravias. Our Leo Bodnar input lag tester returned a figure of 34ms in [Game] mode; and a much less gaming-friendly 119ms in [Movie] mode.\" This review recorded an input lag lower than 34ms:\"After the rather disappointing 60ms-plus input lag reading recorded on the UE65HU8500, it\u2019s great to see the UE55H8000 only hitting a much more gaming-friendly figure of 33ms.\"  The User Manual on the Canadian web site indicates that the television does indeed have a gaming mode. Further, the topic titled \u201cEnabling Game Mode\u201d provides instructions for accessing this feature. For your reference, here is the sequence: MENU &gt;System &gt; General &gt; Game Mode Try Now. There are a few warnings about Game Mode in the User Manual:Game Mode cannot be used for normal TV viewing. Connect the gaming console before enabling Game Mode. Otherwise, the picture quality may suffer. The screen may shake a little. Enabling Game Mode automatically sets the Picture Mode to Standard and the Sound Mode to Movie. To use a different external device, first disconnect the game console and disable Game Mode.  Hope this helps. Looking forward to more reviews. My 55H8000 arrives today. "

I guess I'll soon find out. "

Anything about uniformity is misleading since the U.S. Version has local dimming.   If you read the avforums review, you will find this statement:The only area where the H8000 showed any real weakness was in terms of its backlight uniformity, which was a little patchy in places, although this was only evident on very dark scenes when watching at night. However, we were reviewing an early production sample but, having now seen full production models, the backlight uniformity has been significantly improved. The overall uniformity for our H8000 review sample can be evidenced by the ANSI graphic below, which shows measurements for each of the black and white squares. The H8000 was pleasingly free of the two other common issues often found on LED LCD TVs - dirty screen effect and banding. These can be especially noticeable on football broadcasts, where the camera pans across the pitch or in areas of uniform colour such a sky, so we were glad the H8000 had no such problems.  This same review also includes this statement:The also H8000 doesn't include Samsung's Smart LED feature which is a shame because it really helps with the perceived blacks but its absence is consistent with last year's F8000 model. However the local dimming was very effective, expertly handling our usual assortment of torture tests  Yes, it's a UK site, but it is obvious that uniformity (regardless of the country of origin or availability of local dimming) is very, very good. This is emphasized by this statement taken from a review of an American specification television:The strongest in the market LED edge backlight and black levels really give this Samsung an edge in picture quality over every other LED TV in the market. The 55F8000 has best in class color and contrast that create superior images and the light flow through the the LED backlights is amazing. Images on screen are crisp, and refined compared to some of the other LED TVs out there. The backlight does need to be kept in check because it has the potential to wash colors and contrast out. The safe zone for the backlight setting on this TV is around 70% of capacity.  "

It's there on my Blu ray player, bell dish, etc. etc. I've tried different cables and did the factory reset. I  unplugged the unit for an hour. I'm out of options. The only way to make it less noticeable is to lower the contrast and backlight settings so low that it ruins the picture. I tried the cloth deal from above, it didn't help. I'll be calling Samsung Monday Morning. Outside of the clouding issue I really enjoyed the set. Set up was a breeze. That little smart remote which I'd thought I would hate is so easy to use. I love it. Picture for movies and sports was tremendous. Broadcast TV like fox and nbc with their 1 hour dramas were not nearly as good as film and sport. I'm going to put in moon goo's settings now and see what they are like. The TV is a breeze to assemble. Like pointed out earlier, stand is very flimsy. I make sure to hold on to set when plugging and pulling out cables. I paid 2900 Canadian cash for the set in Toronto before tax and warranty. That's it, that's all I got. What are the odds on this?

You should be good with that blu-ray player. Right now I have the Panasonic DMP-BDT500, but might need to replace it soon as I'm starting to get strange artifacts on the right side of my screen on certain movies. Thought at first it was the movies, but tried a friends player and didn't get it. Let me know how you like the Sammy blu-ray player. Might look into that one myself. Let me know how well it handels 3D as well, as that is something I do like and one of the reasons I went with the bd-t500. "

			"This is emphasized by this statement taken from a review of an American specification television (http://reviews.*******************.com/samsung-tv/samsung-un55f8000.html):The strongest in the market LED edge backlight and black levels really give this Samsung an edge in picture quality over every other LED TV in the market. The 55F8000 has best in class color and contrast that create superior images and the light flow through the the LED backlights is amazing. Images on screen are crisp, and refined compared to some of the other LED TVs out there. The backlight does need to be kept in check because it has the potential to wash colors and contrast out. The safe zone for the backlight setting on this TV is around 70% of capacity."

		"description": "   Quote: Originally Posted by kwcanuck\u00a0 If you read the avforums review, you will find this statement:The only area where the H8000 showed any real weakness was in terms of its backlight uniformity, which was a little patchy in places, although this was only evident on very dark scenes when watching at night. However, we were reviewing an early production sample but, having now seen full production models, the backlight uniformity has been significantly improved. The overall uniformity for our H8000 review sample can be evidenced by the ANSI graphic below, which shows measurements for each of the black and white squares. The H8000 was pleasingly free of the two other common issues often found on LED LCD TVs - dirty screen effect and banding. These can be especially noticeable on football broadcasts, where the camera pans across the pitch or in areas of uniform colour such a sky, so we were glad the H8000 had no such problems.  This same review also includes this statement:The also H8000 doesn't include Samsung's Smart LED feature which is a shame because it really helps with the perceived blacks but its absence is consistent with last year's F8000 model. However the local dimming was very effective, expertly handling our usual assortment of torture tests  Yes, it's a UK site, but it is obvious that uniformity (regardless of the country of origin or availability of local dimming) is very, very good.    I read the AVForum Review earlier this month so I didn't bother to re-read your link to it. They've clearly updated the original review though. It sounds like uniformity should be good. "

To quote this article, Game mode \"...isn't magic, nor does it simply overclock the processors and jack up the performance. Instead, it starts taking things out. Color processing, noise reduction, advanced scaling, all of these aspects and more get thrown out or greatly reduced\". So, the Game mode on the H8000 follows the industry standard to reduce input lag. There are a number of good articles available. Just Google Game Mode. "

		"description": "   I have now set up my H8000, and all I can say is \u201cwow\u201d. The unboxing indicated the care that Samsung take when packaging and shipping their products. The screen was very well protected and the all of the accessories were provided in a separate box. A cleaning cloth was provided, which I thought was a nice touch. The chrome accent strip around the screen and the stand were well protected with plastic film. I recently set up a new Sony television, and the Samsung experience provided a greater sense that someone was paying attention to the details. I have not had time to test the settings provided in a previous post, but picture quality in Movie mode is amazing. I played Master and Commander (an old favorite) tonight and it was stunning. SD video looks very good and Netflix movies look equally good. My only (minor) criticism is that the stand seems a little flimsy. Also, the screen seems prone to reflection from our floor lamps. Small issues. Overall, I would give this television an 8.5 or a 9 out of 10 for picture quality, construction, ease of operation, and features. Most of the reviews I have read to date seem to concur with this assessment. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from other owners. "

I also like the upscaled standard definition TV (dish network), flesh tones could be improved but I have left the picture setting at movie. I had tried the recommended settings in the other thread here but they did not work for me. However the Smart Hub firmware has bugs!, I have rebooted this TV 5 times in last week since I purchased it.1st Issue: (2nd day) Had connected this TV via ethernet but it lost connection to network, removed ethernet and tried via wireless but it could not be fixed, even by resetting the Smart Hub, had to power it off as per instructions from customer support. User guide says that Cat 7 ethernet cables are required but I only have Cat 5e cables so will have to try later with Cat 7.2nd Issue: (3rd day) The wifi lost internet connection, was not resolved by resetting smart hub however resetting the TV fixed it.3rd issue: (6th day) The netflix app stopped working, resetting smart hub did not fix it but resetting the TV fixed it. Will try this TV for 1 more week, if it continues to have problems then it is going back to store Samsung customer service could not tell me if this TV hasBluetooth LE (4.0) CPU Speed (quad core plus means what?) Total Ram (not flash storage)  It currently says 349.8 MB used out of 1.22 GB If anyone knows these specifications, kindly reply.EDIT: Jun 4, 2014 Netflix problem was resolved after talking to netflix support. BTW if you want to go into service menu, the code is Press Mute followed by 1, 8, 2, PWR, the TV will shutdown and restart with Service menu overlay. Be EXTREMELY careful playing around with service menu, there are several posts on AVS forum where people have bricked their sets after changing values. - Have successfully paired Logitech Bluetooth keyboard however most of the apps do not support keyboard for text entry. - This TV does NOT allow Bluetooth audio playback. (Actually none of the smart TV sets support it, this was confirmed by Samsung customer service) Samsung recommends connecting wireless headsets to Audio out port. I am fairly happy with the set after fixing Netflix glitch. The disappointments are (not necessarily with Samsung): 1. Lack of Bluetooth audio I cannot understand why samsung could not put an audio driver for the BT chipset, they support keyboard, mouse, smart remote via bluetooth so why not AUDIO!! IMHO it was a very stupid decision by TV department to exclude BT Audio. 2. APPS a) Apps do not have consistent data entry i.e. very few apps support smart remote, for others you have to use regular remote. It is very frustrating to juggle between two remotes, netflix supports smart remote but almost every other app I have tried requires the use of regular remote with Red, Blue, Green and Yellow keys. b) Keyboard panel in apps for text entry is not consistent E.G. Netflix - The Login Id/Passwd uses regular QWERTY mode but for searching it switches to ABCD mode! This is a samsung issue though because their SDK should NOT expect app developers to fiddle with keyboard layout. c) The weather channel: If you can setup multiple locations without cursing the app then you have far more patience than me d) TV/Movies Section It would tell you if a show is available on Vudu or Hulu to rent/buy but will not show if it is available on netflix or Amazon. How can it not connect to netflix or amazon using their API to search? e) Removing Apps If anyone finds out how to remove pre-installed apps then please let me know e.g. M2Go Samsung App panel developers, please get your act together!! Don't get me wrong, I am fairly happy with the \"TV\" but when I am buying a Smart TV, I expected a bit more polished experience. Feel free to ask any other questions. "

However the Smart Hub firmware has bugs!, I have rebooted this TV 5 times in last week since I purchased it.1st Issue: (2nd day) Had connected this TV via ethernet but it lost connection to network, removed ethernet and tried via wireless but it could not be fixed, even by resetting the Smart Hub, had to power it off as per instructions from customer support. User guide says that Cat 7 ethernet cables are required but I only have Cat 5e cables so will have to try later with Cat 7.2nd Issue: (3rd day) The wifi lost internet connection, was not resolved by resetting smart hub however resetting the TV fixed it.3rd issue: (6th day) The netflix app stopped working, resetting smart hub did not fix it but resetting the TV fixed it. Will try this TV for 1 more week, if it continues to have problems then it is going back to store Samsung customer service could not tell me if this TV hasBluetooth LE (4.0) CPU Speed (quad core plus means what?)

However the Smart Hub firmware has bugs!, I have rebooted this TV 5 times in last week since I purchased it.1st Issue: (2nd day) Had connected this TV via ethernet but it lost connection to network, removed ethernet and tried via wireless but it could not be fixed, even by resetting the Smart Hub, had to power it off as per instructions from customer support. User guide says that Cat 7 ethernet cables are required but I only have Cat 5e cables so will have to try later with Cat 7.2nd Issue: (3rd day) The wifi lost internet connection, was not resolved by resetting smart hub however resetting the TV fixed it.3rd issue: (6th day) The netflix app stopped working, resetting smart hub did not fix it but resetting the TV fixed it. Will try this TV for 1 more week, if it continues to have problems then it is going back to store\u00a0 Samsung customer service could not tell me if this TV has Bluetooth LE (4.0) CPU Speed (quad core plus means what?) Total Ram (not flash storage)  If anyone knows these specifications, kindly reply.  The positive in this is that the software can be fixed. \u00a0It sounds like the hardware (picture) is pretty good. \u00a0What size did you go with? \u00a0 Samsung says this about their processor:\u00a0 Quote:  Enjoy a smoother Smart TV experience with a powerful Quad Core Plus processor. More than twice as fast as a Quad Core processor, it delivers smoother and faster navigation and multitasking for web browsing, switching between content and more.   \u00a0 It sounds like it is a faster clock speed on the CPU. \u00a0 \u00a0 I haven't heard anything about bluetooth in my research. \u00a0I also haven't found anything related to how much RAM   "

		"description": "   Sorry Everyone for not getting back sooner ... It's been overwhelming getting this unit set up and we love this TV so much now we can't stop watching / fiddling with it. \u00a0 It needs a minimal amount of tinkering out of the box - that's nothing new ...\u00a0After changing to 'Movie' mode, that was really all it took to get a decent picture that I watched all afternoon. \u00a0 Yea, we spent the whole entire afternoon watching French Open Tennis - Sorry! \u00a0 Then yesterday we had to go back to Best Buy (Canada) and buy a TV stand to go with it ... (Whalen BBCXL54-NV - Reg: $269.00 / Paid: $199.00) ... So, we spent the 2nd day putting that together and watching more TV (I'm an old retired guy so I need to take breaks)\u00a0 \u00a0 I did notice some motion judder / stuttering in the fast tennis action but it wasn't overly bad ... Just the same, I went to &lt;Auto Motion Plus&gt; under Picture --&gt; Options and changed the setting to &lt;Standard&gt; - I saw no more stuttering after that.\u00a0 \u00a0 Also, at first - the 65\" was kind of overwhelming even at 10 feet away ... coming from a 50\" Panasonic Viera plasma - Not a shabby TV either. In any case now with a viewing distance of 12' - I love it and don't think we'll ever go to the movie theater again. \u00a0 \u00a0 Just some facts and observations now ... \u00a0 Model: UN65H8000AFXZC / Panel: TS01 No dead / stuck pixels \u00a0 Best Buy: List Price - $3799.99 and includes a Samsung Galaxy TABPRO 10.1\" Tablet (worth $520.00) ... {FYI - This is expensive and was an ok deal ONLY because I wanted the TABPRO 10.1\" - 2560x1600} \u00a0 Measured Power: 2 Watts in STANDBY ... 145 Watts while ON ... Measured using the BluePlanet EM100 Energy Meter {FYI - The old Viera plasma ran between 480 - 550 Watts ... No kidding} \u00a0 Picture wise: It looks fabulous! ... However, I did notice some small back light bleed around the edge and some uneven lighting when viewing a black screen but take that with a grain of salt since I don't (yet) have a calibration disc so I can't be really sure of what I'm looking at and the thing is not totally set up yet. \u00a0 I did NOT notice any banding - none in any viewing done over these few days. \u00a0 One thing I can mention - I used HDMI-1 for Bell Satellite (PVR) and HDMI-2 for the Bluray player for movie viewing ... By default, the unit is configured to change settings on ALL inputs - change this to apply setting changes to affect only the input your viewing - If that's what you want ... I wasted a few hours tinkering with the Bluray for movies and went to the PVR input and tinkered there and lost all my Bluray settings - Argggh. \u00a0 Last word - I watched a few minutes of 'Lawrence of Arabia' on Bluray - I guess they can't make 'em like that any more - Anyway, the visuals are stunning but on this set they are jaw-dropping (My 2 cents) \u00a0 Let me know if you want any other info but it may take a while to report back - Once you turn on the H8000 Curved - It ain't easy to walk away.

Hopefully some reviews come out soon.   The F8000 does have a true 240hz processor. Amazon can only advertise the true value in their title and it states 240hz for that TV. Seems like the only differences are a few little things like a new coating on the screen to improve contrast, a new software enhancement to improve depth of image, and a faster quad core processor for the smart TV system. IF those new image hardware / software elements do actually result in a improved image I guess I would go for the H8000 over the F8000 unless they give some crazy discount on the F8000 (as of right now they are way too close in pricing).. Personally looking for a 65inch and now that 65in 4k from Samsung and Sony are retailing for $4000 (and that will likely drop in a few months) wondering if its worth waiting and purchasing a more future proof 4K tv... I've been impressed with 4k content on larger screens, but seeing as how ill be sitting 10 ft away - wonder if ill note a difference. Big benefit I see is with 3D since it will be passive and 1080p to each eye (passive sets to my eyes are MUCH more comfortable for anything over 30 mins - I honestly don't think the active sets are good for vision, I'm in dental school not medical - but learned enough about eye anatomy to realize how eye strain can cause long term problems).. So its a conundrum.. "

I think the processor for Smart Hub is faster on H8000. Don't know for certain but I think it's double than F8000. Do you think there will be the same Samsung made TS01 PANEL in the H8000 since it's curved? "

Contrast ratios have stayed more or less the same the last few years on the high end Samsungs. But if there is some sort of substantial increase in contrast ratio with the H8000 it may a reason for me to upgrade from the F8000.   I didn't read that it was a newer version than the F8000.. I just figured they're trying to compete with Sonys Triluminous but if the F8000 had it I'm sure the H8000 is prob the same. I just think its a steep price for a 65in 1080p LCD in this day to be above the 3k price point (regardless of features). Like DRN94 noted, if the picture quality isn't greatly changed, i could care less for the smart hub either since I use my Apple TV and Oppo for everything.. So its all about picture quality, if the F goes on a decent sale id consider. The 2013 F9000 4k is actually $3500 right now - but I read some not so great reviews that turned me off to considering it, maybe the 2014 4ks will be improved. "

Yea so that was my concern - image quality (upscaling) since I have a decent blu-ray collection and motion handling.. Since it seems like 4k is going to be the new standard its just making me itch to get in on it, but you're right I think the current 4ks work at 30hz which causes a lot of motion blur, even at 60hz it won't look anything like the 240hz 1080p sets. It'll be a while before they fix that problem so I guess the most logical is F vs H8000 right now. Wait a few weeks to see how the H8000 reviews fare and how the F8000 prices change. "

		"description": "   I am shocked with the contrast ratio numbers on the H8000 in that review. The black level on the H8000 is almost twice that than on the F8000. Uniformity has also suffered, probably because of the difficulty of evenly distributing light across a curved screen. My F8000 has nearly perfect uniformity with no DSE whatsoever, the F8000 was praised for it's backlight uniformity. Now I'm even more glad I got the F8000. This is rather bizzare. Sony's W950B 1080p flagship for 2014 was supremely disappointing compared to the previous W900A flagship. And now Samsung's 1080p flagship is rather disappointing as well but not nearly as much as the Sony. Honestly, if you're into a 1080p set get the F8000. If you're interested in a 2014 set rather than the F8000, the flat 4K flagship may be the best option. That H8000 review also states that the 4K curved model has similar backlight uniformity issues. I foresaw these quality problems many many months ago as manufacturers were looking towards gimmicks to sell their TV's and not improve the picture quality. The W950B was a HUGE step backwards in terms of picture quality and the H8000 is a slight step backwards as well (lower contrast ratio, poor uniformity). Stay away from both of these TV's. "

I have the 55\" which was the size most reviewers looked at and it appeared to have the best uniformity out of all the other sizes. I didn't read the whole review but I didn't see any mention of the dimming. They have the UK version which may not have the dimming perhaps.

		"description": "   weird they make the US and UK versions with different software based enhancements? But I am sure that the Samsung website said local dimming for the H8000 and the 4k model above it (just checked). As far as the F8000.. the reviews I read stated pretty significant uniformity issues without engaging the local dimming (but excellent uniformity after that was engaged). For those that had no issues even with it turned off I guess it may have been luck of the draw. I know I was pretty unlucky with my first 60in 7100 and 2 Sony 850As. But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.

In close-up shots of the field you could almost count the blades of grass. I saw no motion blur at all especially when the camera pans during a long pass.  Regarding what Ken said about the \"fault finders\" once they find a fault then they can't unsee it. The best way to avoid that is to not look for it.

These TV's are well packed and there are detailed instructions on how to handle it and installing the stand. Where ever you get it from, you are going to be extremely happy.       I'll probably just stick with Amazon since the delivery is roughly the same.  It's also $3 cheaper.  I'm still trying get the wife to agree to 65\".  Crossing my fingers.  Thanks for the tip on Crutchfield and the info. "

The viewing experience is completely different :-) If the H8000 has any flaws I don't notice them, I just enjoy the great, to me, picture  I'm not a gamer so I have no idea as to that side of things. Only thing connected to the set is my BP through a Denon AVR.  Stepping up from 23\" is huge! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do, and I believe many other owners of the set do also.       Blu-Rays are so much fun. I can't wait to really see them for the first time.     Quote:        Originally Posted by AncientAlien      Has the 55\" been discontinued?

It was from PC Richards which was a NY to CA delivery. I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don't know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don't have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it's also the most money I've ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don't even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray. "

The picture is amazingly more crisp and sharp from the factory settings. One thing I wanted to ask is there a way to make the picture quality less \"Soap Operaish\"? I remember I bought a LG led, and that was was the worst Soap Opera effect setting I have encountered but there was a setting which allowed it to take it off. Is there something for the Samsung as well? Thanks to everyone for sharing there experience with this tv set on this thread. "

I've never owned a Samsung before but decided to take the plunge after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon.  TV &amp; movies look absolutely amazing on this thing.  But I bought it primarily to game on, and that's where I'm running into problems.  When I turn on game mode, my heart sinks.  The picture quality very noticeably drops &amp; the colors all become dull and lifeless no matter how much I play with the picture settings.  I know what GTA V is capable of looking like, as I've played it for many months on my Sony, and it looks dead on this thing.  Terrible aliasing as well.  And while there's no real motion blur to speak of, the picture is still significantly jittery when panning.  Obviously I can turn game mode off &amp; turn on the Clear Motion feature (which actually works beautifully), but then the input lag makes the game totally unplayable.  I hate to say it, but my old Vizio M series had a better game mode than this TV and the Vizio was 1/3 the price.  Of course the Vizio's picture quality wasn't nearly as good for TV/movies though.  I've read through every post on this thread and am surprised nobody mentioned the noticable drop in PQ when switching to Game/PC mode.  Does anyone have any advice on how to get it looking decent?  I feel like for what I paid for this TV, it should meet my expectations--and at the moment, it does not.  If I want mediocre PQ while gaming, I'd just go back to the Vizio and save myself hundreds of dollars.  And one other disappointing discovery so far: The Hulu app won't output 5.1 on the UN48H8000.  It did on my Bravia.  I called Samsung &amp; they told me to call Hulu.  Called Hulu &amp; they claim they don't even transmit 5.1.  Huh??  Then how was I getting surround sound all that time with my Sony?  Are you guys able to get 5.1 with Hulu at all?  Grrrr, if only Sony had made that Bravia in 120hz it would have been so perfect! "

I've never owned a Samsung before but decided to take the plunge after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon.  TV &amp; movies look absolutely amazing on this thing.  But I bought it primarily to game on, and that's where I'm running into problems.  When I turn on game mode, my heart sinks.  The picture quality very noticeably drops &amp; the colors all become dull and lifeless no matter how much I play with the picture settings.  I know what GTA V is capable of looking like, as I've played it for many months on my Sony, and it looks dead on this thing.  Terrible aliasing as well.  And while there's no real motion blur to speak of, the picture is still significantly jittery when panning.  Obviously I can turn game mode off &amp; turn on the Clear Motion feature (which actually works beautifully), but then the input lag makes the game totally unplayable.

Actually I read somewhere about this issue with this Samsung tv someone tried gaming but wasn't happy with its  gaming mode. At the end there was a solution, I hope someone can chime in and help this fella out, because I can't seem to find where I saw the post, maybe it was on Amazons reviews or somewhere on the net. Don't give up on this tv just yet because of the PQ on game mode, there's definitely a solution to it. I haven't gamed on this tv yet, but planning to soon, so I too would like an answer to this.  Cheers! "

Cheers!       I hope you're right!  When you go to enable game mode though, it even says in the little description box \"There may be a slight degradation in graphic quality.\"  That's the understatement of the century.  I swear it makes my PS3 games look like PS2 games, and completely destroys the vibrant colors this TV is capable of producing in the other modes.  Everything looks flat, like on a cheap Vizio.  Why would they need to dumb down the colors in order to reduce input lag??  Anyway, Samsung is supposedly going to have someone contact me to try and find a solution.  If they can't, I've already made up my mind that I'm going to swap the H8000 for a Sony KDL50W800B instead (same TV as I had before, only bigger &amp; 120hz).  Sad because I know the KDL50W800B will be inferior to the Samsung in every other way, but the game mode on the H8000 is just not going to work for me unless there's some sort of workaround. "

I managed to walk out of there with the TV and 4 year warranty for the $1799 price. I was pretty stoked...until I got home. The ghosting on this TV was absolutely horrible! I returned the TV yesterday and was hesitant to bring home another fearing similar issues. Of course the Black Friday sale wasn't going on any longer but there are still a few TV's on sale. I noticed the UN55HU8000 on sale for $1899. Not a 4K but I really only went for the 4K based on the price. I managed to get the HU8000 at the exact deal I got on the HU7250 so I'm happy.  Now who has some killer settings!? "

I did get reflection from the lights in the room opposite the tv. This was very distracting. You could see a red ribbon across the top of the screen and sometimes a rainbow effect. Since then, I have wall mounted in a room with no windows. Fortunately, the light in that room is behind the tv and the main light is protected from view by a ceiling drop. Without any reflection on the screen, I get little to no glare. The walls are painted dark brown behind the tv and side walls are a bit lighter brown to help with a theatre setting.

I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don't know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don't have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it's also the most money I've ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don't even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.       Hi Neo,  As to the panel version, look on the end of the packing box. There should be an area that tells you the Model and serial number as well as the Version:, that may be a TS01 or TS02... Or you can find the label on the back of the set on the opposite side of the connector inputs.  I'm one of those folks who likes the curved screen. My engineer brain points out that when I look from the center out to the edges, from where I sit, the distance is almost the same. So what that means is the pixels are straight on, seems optimal to me. If I do the same with a flat screen, as I look to the edges I am looking at an ever increasing angle, i.e. the distance is further away as I look to the edges, just like moving off to the side from dead center. Just my view of the curved screen. I love my 55H8000.  The sound is much better also as I finally have my Denon 4520CI all hooked up. Just need to do a bit of clean up and run Audyssey. Even so, it sounds pretty nice  Also thinking of adding a second subwoofer, maybe SVS SB-2000 or SVS PC-2000... Although after watching U-571 last night I'm not sure I need anymore impact during the depth charge attack "

		"description": "   Ok, so I think I'm the first person on here to purchase one of the Asian model numbers of this set. Mine is: UA65H8000 with a TS01 panel. TV looks beautiful, but I'm having trouble with the HDMI inputs. I have 3 sources I want to connect to it:  1) Set Top Box 2) Windows 7 PC 3) PlayStation 4  Set Top seems to be required to go into HDMI input 1. No problem. Works great.  The Windows PC works fine plugged into HDMI input 4. But plugging it in to inputs 2 or 3 results in the screen resolution dropping to only 640x480. Windows displays it as a generic display with no option to set the resolution correctly. But through HDMI input 4 all is well and normal.  The PS4 was originally plugged into HDMI input 2. I've heard others use this successfully. But when I plug it it, the picture is fine, but there is no sound. The same happens when I plug it into input 3. I tried everything to fix it, swapping out cables, switching inputs, trying different audio settings on the PS4, turning things on and off. Apparently there is an issue with the 2.0 firmware update on the PS4 sometimes causing there to be an issue with the audio output over HDMI.  However, if I plug the PS4 into HDMI input 4, then the sound returns and everything works fine! Of course the problem now is that if I want to switch from the PC to the Playstation, I have to manually unplug and replug the HDMI cables. I had assumed that an HDMI input is basically and HDMI input and they they were relatively standard and interchangeable. There was no issue on my 5 year old LG TV this Samsung replaced.  So... any workarounds or suggestions for how I could get both the Playstation and Windows PC both plugged into the TV and functioning correctly? "

Thanks guys, please respond ASAP if possible.       I've had the UN65H8000 TV over a month and I really love it. I was exactly in the same boat before purchase. I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn't disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn't make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don't even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven't tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn't much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that's why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( &gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money. "

I thought they used 110v in Panama, but if it does need a converter, does anyone have any recommendations (something that won't cause any interference and maybe that has a standby mode or doesn't draw much power with the set off?)  Can anyone confirm or deny any of these and/or shed any light on what I should expect?  Thank you. "

I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don't know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don't have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it's also the most money I've ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don't even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.       For gaming you don't need to set an input name to PC on this particular TV.  To get the benefits of lower input lag on any input you just enable the \"Game Mode\" setting in your general settings menu.  This will allow you to be able to also have your Movie mode setup appropriately even if the input is from your game console, just make sure Game Mode is turned off and that your picture mode is set to Movie.  Then when you want to play a game just flip on Game Mode.  I noticed on my set that they way over - sharpen the image out of the box.  I believe movie mode was set to like 50 and standard was set to like 20 out of the box or vice versa. If your input sources are good you will NEVER need your sharpening set to anything past 5 in my experience.  I keep sharpening off completely for any modes coming out of my PS4 and 5 sharpening for my standard mode which I use for cable TV.  Looks fantastic!!  One last note.  For the absolute best image quality make sure you set your picture size to \"screen fit\" which will ensure that you get perfect 1:1 pixel mapping from your sources.

		"description": "     Hello. Per reviews I've read and recommendations on this forum I decided to buy the 55\" H8000 HDTV. I must say I'm quite pleased with it. THERE IS a difference between the H8000 and my former 32F6300 in terms of image quality. It's just a pleasure to watch it.  As one of the main purposes of my tv is to play video games (mostly PC games via my PC and some PS4 ones) and being accustomed to the great performance in that matter of my F6300 I must say the H8000 is quite as good as the F6300 but the F6300 still leads in terms of lag but the differente is nothing to talk about. In fact all reviews have given the H8000 a GREAT test result in gaming performance and I agree.  The PC mode works fantastically well. I am attaching two photos I took while playing Max Payne 3 with my PC all settings at full. The image and sense of immersion is really UNBELIEVABLES. Words cannot describe the feeling you just got to experience it first hand. The imperfections/pixelations shonw in the photos are because of my iPhone camera NOT the TV.  The only bad thing is that yesterday, just one week after buying it I discovered a RED STUCK PIXEL right in the middle of the screen that is quite noticiable although it's only one. Of course it's noticeable mostly only in dark/black screens but this tv it's a beauty showing black images so that's really a pity.  I read stuck pixels are more treatable than dead pixels. I tried the jscreenfix solution for about 20 minutes and although the intensity of the red stuck pixel diminished it went back again after some time. Then I tried this other site: www.flexcode.org and I noticed that just starting it the red stuck pixel light diminished more and then I left it also for about 20 minutes. The light have diminished but still there and last time I saw there was no light. It was very late at night so I couldn't keep trying but before turning off the TV I almost saw no light on the red stuck pixel. I don't know if the stuck pixel will come back but at least it diminished with said methods and that is saying something. Hopefully I can fix it. Though I'm a little OCD about it it's certainly disturbing to have said stuck pixel. "

Going with the 8000 is the best compromise for right now. "

I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn't disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn't make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don't even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven't tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn't much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that's why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( &gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money.       You had me fully convinced to get the H8000 but then you said the hu8550 at the very end lol. I tried the hu8550 already and it had ghosting issues and audio sync problems. I don't know if I just had a bad hu8550 or if this problem will persist. Everything else was really nice on the TV though. SO basically it is ust down to the hu8550 and the H8000. It also sucks to buy a TV right now because I know Samsung will be releasing new TVs in late March I was told. "

I'm trying to get the most out of the settings and, even if it's a fairly new tv, I haven't got much help from the internet in terms of calibrations. I'm using the tv as a pc monitor and learned it's a good idea to rename HDMI to PC, I did it, but find the image is kind of lacking in something I can't put my finger on. It looks blurrier than before?  I know all tv:s should be treated individually, but does anyone of you know the best settings for pc mode, game mode (both on pc and ps3) and movie mode for this particular model? I'm currently using pc mode for browsing the internet, but when it comes to watching videos or movies there must be a better way, should I always switch to movie mode when I open a video on youtube for example?  Bear with me, I'm really new with these kinds of tv:s. Any help would be appreciated! "

My Directv channels vary quite a bit - HBO, Showtime, BBCA look consistently great, while other shows - especially dark looking ones, like 'Sleepy Hollow' can have significant blocky artifacts in dark areas. And some shows look sharp and in focus, while others look soft. But Blu-Rays look fine, so I believe it is not the set, but the quality of the broadcast from Directv, which of course is compressed quite a bit.  Have you tried calibrating your set? I have been able to both improve the Directv picture and hide many of the artifacts by changing the settings on mine. "

		"description": "   So far so good on this TV. Had it for a while now and no issues. Just wanted to note.  I can't stand Movie mode. It looks so lifeless. So far I'm finding the best picture is with the Natural mode, which I don't see many people suggesting. Just my opinion though. You can get standard to look pretty good, too. But there was an earlier post about the best settings in Movie mode from consumer reports or something and I thought it was bleh.  I just got a Yamaha YAS-93 sound bar. It's fantastic. The built in speakers were surprisingly good on the TV but this is just so much better. Got it at Costco for $190 ($230+ on Amazon).  Only question I have is that the TV only gives two options: PCM or DTS Neo 2:5. I have no idea which one to choose. Both seem to sound similar. I'm not audiophile so just wondering what you guys are using and what your thoughts are. "

		"description": "   I will try to remember tonight, if nobody else has answered.  At any rate, I have had this TV since shortly after it was released, in the form of the UN65H8000. The first panel I got had horrible light bleed in the lower left &amp; upper right corners. As many know, any light, including bleed, really rides the curve of the screen, creating faux-clouding. At any rate, I returned it &amp; the guy on the phone said he had a refused delivery that he could sell with full waranty as \"New; Opened Box\", for 50% off. Well, that was over a year ago &amp; that TDxx panel is darn near perfect. I really enjoy it &amp; while the curve doesn't do much for me  when it comes to movies &amp; TV, it is awesome while grinding away time on my PS4.  I think I will keep it in the media room for another year or two &amp; then look at the 75+ SUHD models. BTW, anyone considering picking one of these up, keep an eye out for deals from Paul's TV &amp; Appliance. They are an online retailer (big provider for Amazon) &amp; they also have brick &amp; mortar locations in Southern California. I have found them very helpful, honest &amp; reliable in my past dealings, going back over a decade.  Any way, as I was saying, this TV gives you a cool perspective when playing FPS games &amp; the brightness &amp; color are amazing. The video settings are pretty robust, so you can really dial in color, black, contrast &amp; brightness setting to your individual preference. I see a lot of people talk about certain calibration settings, but each panel will respond from slightly to extremely different to each setting. For me, I just start at the factory settings &amp; then use what changes were made in the calibration details in the forum, adjusting &amp; readjusting till they look good to my eyes, which is all that really matters in the end.

		"description": "   Thank you for a reply! I have not found default settings yet, its still manageable picture quality but i just can't erase \"Something is wrong, PQ was better\" from my head. I am pretty sure i screwed up white balance settings since right now every value in sub menu is 128 and i am pretty sure it was different before. Even if panels are not comparable i still want to see maybe a possible tweaking window.  I love this tv, hooked up all consoles and pc and its amazing in game mode. Only complaint is that one of the recent firmware updates screwed up brightness setting for game mode but it was tweakable and not such a big pain. Please take some photos of service menu if you can. But remember if you even just enter service menu without changing anything it will reset all your picture settings from normal user interface. "

		"description": "   Hi guys! I bought  UE-H8000 TV a months ago and almost from the day 1 this TV started rebooting all the time while watching it. The auto power shut off is not enabled. It turns off then automatically turns right back on. It does this multiple times everyday and is not a factor of being on too long, as it has happened only 5 minutes after turning on or it may happen after 1 hour. The process takes about 30 seconds and doesn't require any work on my part but the tv is only 1 month old. The local Samsung official service could not resolve this issue. I have tried suggestions from the different internet forums and topics, including some settings in my Wi-Fi router, but it doesn't help. Does anyone have the same issue or know how to resolve it? "

You're a GENIUS!!!! I followed your advised and based on said advise grab just a little more information and used a pencil (on the eraser side) and double covered it with a soft microfiber cloth I use to clean my glasses. I placed the pencil eraser (covered as I said) exactly on the stuck pixel very firmly and shut down my TV. Once the TV was shut down I pressed it even more firmly (something I have never done to any tv before) and turned on the TV and the pixel was still there but barely there. So, I repeated the procedure once again \"pressing\" the pixel even harder than before, kept it that away for about 10 seconds and then turned on again the tv. Then, like playing a tablet game there was still a very little part of the pixel (it was now moving like if it was alive!) and without turning off the tv or pressing hard, just touched said pixel and then it was gone!!!  I've been using the TV playing movies and stuff (I haven't turn it down yet because I'm working with my PC on the same room) and the stuck pixel is not there. The all black, all blue screens where the pixel was most noticeable shows no stuck pixel. Just a few minutes ago I played the same movie in the same scene that was when I discovered the stuck pixel and it's not there. In other words: the stuck pixel is gone!!!! I just couldn't believe you just could literally \"erase\" a stuck pixel!!!!!  Your post was so assuring and helpful!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! "

Number two: If it sounds to good to be true, it probably isn't. Number three: Do yourself a huge favor(if you can afford to)and only buy if it ships directly from Amazon. Number four: If you have the opportunity, audition one in person at a big box store like Best Buy, Abt, PCRichard, HHGregg etc.  And finally, I would never buy an open box, no matter how attractive the price  Of course, you are entitled to do what you wish, but I'm hoping you will take my four points into consideration.  One more thing. I can strongly recommend Crutchfield. They are an authorized retailer. They offer a 60 day money back guarantee, free shipping and free lifetime tech support. I have bought numerous products from them and their customer service is excellent.   "

Maybe I was expecting more   Release prices are generally more than I'm willing to pay so if I come across a good price I'll pick up something I want.  Post your impressions. I'm certainly not sorry to have these titles in my small collection. I know I'll eventually watch them all again.  WOW, I hope you can win the contest!  PS: I don't know about Amazon UK. "

The tv looks great, the colors are very nice and the tests I've seen in a few different shops was great.  But when I watch a movie via my computer(connecting like a second screen) I am not happy with the results at all. Its a bit choppy, nothing like the tests at the shop. It feels like the hz is very low and I get frustrated and instead just watches the movie on my computer screen.  I also tried copying the movie over on an usb and tried connecting to the tv, same issue, not impressed.  Is there any settings I can change? After 2 years back and forth with phillips I'm so feckin angry I could explode. Why won't my tv just work? "

I compare it to my brothers 50 inch LG and i feel like he gets a consistently better clearer picture on Cable channels.. he has Verizon Fios Cable while i have directv.. Im tempted to exchange this set for a 70LB7100 LG.. but i see a lot of mixed reviews for it I tried playing some movies from my laptop connected to the tv via HDMI cable.. and it did look like crap I transferred some of the movies over to an external drive, and connected it directly to the tv using USB.. and they played significantly better.. Dont really understand that either... If i change a channel, i feel like i have to adjust the settings every time.. "

But I wasn't exactly looking after it either because I asumed everything would be allright. I'll certainly look closer next time.  It's not like its a HUGE problem, something you notice straight away or is very easily noticable. But there is always this feeling something is not right and when I look closer its good or pretty. So its making very uncertain if its a fault with the tv or just me having too high expectations.  On the other hand my old phillips felt smoother than this one, so that really should says something.

		"description": "   Hey Imoen if you are still around... I set up an exchange with Best Buy and then quickly canceled it after I saw these comments from another thread in here for a similar tv and then played around with them  My general settings where I get no flash lighting are Standard, brightness 34, backlight 3-7 (night time, nice and dark) but change it to 10-15 (daytime when blinds are open. I will notice flash lighting when I go 7+ on backlight or higher than 34 on the brightness), Contrast 90, Eco mode off, Dynamic Contrast LOW (This I feel pops the picture slightly without losing detail in the color gradients any higher I notice the grey bar deviate too much from the true picture), and Dark for the black level ( this I feel makes sure the image source is always getting black in the picture to improve the contrast, any higher and you get black crush), sharpness is set to 40, color 50, Tint I think off the top of my head was 44/56 or somewhere around there. I noticed the set had some slight green hue, so I had to trim that and add some red. I used the TV's blue color filter with some CD calibration tool I downloaded here. For the picture I use Cool (sports) or Warm 1 (movies/TV). I have LED motion off, Cinema Off, Motion rate is set to Clear, HDMI level is LOW. I found that the HDMI level low gives me the best deep blacks especially at night. But I counter it with gamma +3 to bring out any dark shadows in the picture. Reason why is that When I look at cable content I notice that since the Cable HD source quality is lower than that of blue ray or video games the deeper grey/blacks sometimes get lost. The increase in gamma brings it out. However if that is not enough for the content I'm viewing I bring it back to Normal, But that's pretty rare...the content has to be a very low quality such as a poor video stream. The mpg stuff I leave on auto I like it since it makes the picture look better on downloaded movies I view with lower quality on such a big set. Blue Ray or Video game content looks phenomenal and feel like it has a nice color range with HDMI Black Low. I think that's it for my settings.  What has made an impact for me with this tv is  standard mode- backlight 16-18 (i change this based on what im watching) brightness 43-47 (same as above) dynamic contrast - high gamma- +3 digital clean view - high or auto MPEG noise filter- high or auto sharpness 30-40 Auto Motion Plus - clear Smart Led- Low  Once i switched to these, i got caught watching 300 Rise of An Empire on cinemax.. and stayed up way late.. and couldnt stop watching..  This is for Directv viewing only.. when i switch to another input or source youd have to change these again.. Is there a way to save settings for USB input and different hdmi inputs without changing these every time? I realize these settings go against all the others that have been posted here, but this seems to be a very subjective thing from person to person im seeing I dont see how anyone could use Movie mode.. it is so dull, lifeless, and dark..

Picture quality rated by most as better than anything out there. We are still using a 50\" 8 year old Panasonic plasma but it still looks good and only has 15,000 hours on it. Really hesitant to buy now but we're not so sure the Panny will make it until prices start falling on our preferred OLED TVs. A couple of grand for retired fixed incomes is a hard decision but we do love the big screens/great picture. "

I set up an exchange with Best Buy and then quickly canceled it after I saw these comments from another thread in here for a similar tv and then played around with them  My general settings where I get no flash lighting are Standard, brightness 34, backlight 3-7 (night time, nice and dark) but change it to 10-15 (daytime when blinds are open. I will notice flash lighting when I go 7+ on backlight or higher than 34 on the brightness), Contrast 90, Eco mode off, Dynamic Contrast LOW (This I feel pops the picture slightly without losing detail in the color gradients any higher I notice the grey bar deviate too much from the true picture), and Dark for the black level ( this I feel makes sure the image source is always getting black in the picture to improve the contrast, any higher and you get black crush), sharpness is set to 40, color 50, Tint I think off the top of my head was 44/56 or somewhere around there. I noticed the set had some slight green hue, so I had to trim that and add some red. I used the TV's blue color filter with some CD calibration tool I downloaded here. For the picture I use Cool (sports) or Warm 1 (movies/TV). I have LED motion off, Cinema Off, Motion rate is set to Clear, HDMI level is LOW. I found that the HDMI level low gives me the best deep blacks especially at night. But I counter it with gamma +3 to bring out any dark shadows in the picture. Reason why is that When I look at cable content I notice that since the Cable HD source quality is lower than that of blue ray or video games the deeper grey/blacks sometimes get lost. The increase in gamma brings it out. However if that is not enough for the content I'm viewing I bring it back to Normal, But that's pretty rare...the content has to be a very low quality such as a poor video stream. The mpg stuff I leave on auto I like it since it makes the picture look better on downloaded movies I view with lower quality on such a big set. Blue Ray or Video game content looks phenomenal and feel like it has a nice color range with HDMI Black Low. I think that's it for my settings.  What has made an impact for me with this tv is  standard mode- backlight 16-18 (i change this based on what im watching) brightness 43-47 (same as above) dynamic contrast - high gamma- +3 digital clean view - high or auto MPEG noise filter- high or auto sharpness 30-40 Auto Motion Plus - clear Smart Led- Low  Once i switched to these, i got caught watching 300 Rise of An Empire on cinemax.. and stayed up way late.. and couldnt stop watching..  This is for Directv viewing only.. when i switch to another input or source youd have to change these again.. Is there a way to save settings for USB input and different hdmi inputs without changing these every time? I realize these settings go against all the others that have been posted here, but this seems to be a very subjective thing from person to person im seeing I dont see how anyone could use Movie mode.. it is so dull, lifeless, and dark..       First off, let me say that this will be my last post on this God forsaken forum period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  truerogue With all of the futzing and tinkering you do I wonder if you will ever really be satisfied(I don't think so). Then you sit there and say \"I can see flashlighting with these settings but not with the other settings. The only reason you see flashlighting is because you are sitting there looking for it. You seem to be searching for the perfect picture. If there was a perfect TV, AVS Forum wouldn't exist because there would be nothing to complain about. Perhaps you should return the TV and listen to the radio, but you would probably find something to complain about whilst doing that.  As I've said before, I believe the Samsung H8000 series HDTV is one of the finest TV's on the market today. I sure am enjoying mine.   GOODBYE  AVS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    "

If it's dark, ( night scene), their faces have a great hue to them and look normal but if it's light out or they're in their kitchen the faces look washed out.  It's the same with outdoor scenes on live action shows as well.  Bumping the color up fixes it a little.  Could it it be the contrast is too high? "

Need to decide if I should buy the 55\" at 2 grand or the 65\" at 2.7 grand for that enhanced home theater experience. I have to buy at PC Richards as I have some credit there. As it is for my bedroom I would be fine with either size, but I don't want to have that need to upgrade feeling later on. However the 65\" one is slightly pricey for me and I might just settle for a 55\" with an XBOX One. I already have the PS4 but I am a fan of the respective systems exclusives like Halo and The Last of Us. Buying the 65\" would put off the XBOX One purchase til Next year for sure, and I will be late to the party with Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Tough choice for me. "

As for how the H8000  compares to the M70, the H8000 will trounce the Vizio in color  reproduction and picture video processing but it can be argued that the  M70 has a more effective dimming scheme and it's a much better value.  I'm hopeful Vizio with their FALD televisions will shame Samsung towards  offering such televisions at affordable prices next year because  frankly I think Samsung can do them a lot better.  Forget the freakin  curve panels.  Forget the freakin voice commands. "

Today I accidentally turned off my TV from the remote control and then immediately turn it on (after 4 to 5 sec). There was no picture on the screen, but sound was coming out from the speakers. I could switch the channel, but again no picture nothing on the screen. Then I turned it off again, waited for 1 minutes and turned on. The picture was back. Updated firmware to the latest version, but it didn't fix the issue.  It looks like software problem, but I didn't find any claims about the same issue on forums. Or maybe better to replace it? "

Only thing I've noticed is that voice can be really faint, I sometimes have to crank the volume to 50 even though there's no sound in the apt and the TV is like 10 feet away. The clear voice sound option helps but then everything sounds washed out. Hoping the Soundbar will help with that by providing more balance across the range. "

		"description": "   Hi there. So as I \"suffer\" a \"little\" OCD and couldn't find the correct  fit-all height for my TV and tried and tried a lot of possible  configurations and furniture I decided the way to go was to have the TV  attached to a TV mount. One TV mount with height adjust, tilt adjust so I  could move up or down, forward or back and tilt my TV as I needed. This  because when I play video games with my TV I seat near and when  watching movies I sit far and when watching music videos not to far not  to back...anyway.  There isn't a lot of options but I bought the  best one being that I could easily say this is the best commercial  available TV mount on the market: The Omni Mount Play 70.  I  installed with some professional help and words nor picture do justice  for how beautiful the TV looks. It looks like it is suspended in the  air. I can recommend this TV mount 100%.  I have attached some pictures. Please excuse the low quality of the iPhone pictures. "

A great collection for someone like me who likes Halo, dabbled in it, but never played half of them or played them to death. And I am looking forward to watching Blu-Rays in style like Captain America 2 in 3D, playing The Last of Us Remastered on a quality display bigger than 23 inches is going to be awesome.       Hi Neo,  I gave up watching TV about 14 years ago. Several years ago I decided to get a bluray player and watch movies on my 27\" 1080 computer monitor. Finally decided to go bigger and ended up getting the 55H8000. The viewing experience is completely different :-) If the H8000 has any flaws I don't notice them, I just enjoy the great, to me, picture  I'm not a gamer so I have no idea as to that side of things. Only thing connected to the set is my BP through a Denon AVR.  Stepping up from 23\" is huge! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do, and I believe many other owners of the set do also. "

The Cinema Black feature does an amazing job at keeping blacks pitch black on letter bars even in a pitch black room. Im shocked, I figured only OLED could cure this issue (plasma aside).  The local dimming is pretty crazy here as well, credits, in a pitch black room with smart led enabled, I barely see any light blooming whatsoever around the lettering, unlike the Sonys, and black levels overall are phenomenal (tested Prometheus, scenes set in space, star fields looked phenomenal considering this is edge lit).  Also, something minor, but with speakers set to audio out, there is no popup whatsoever when using my Samsung smart remote to control my external speaker.  Other than that, motion is on point, couldnt be happier with it, gaming performance on gaming mode is excellent, no noticeable lag.  This TV has it all.       I'm curious, have you watched any 4:3 content with side bars and if so how uniform do they look (I'll be happy to hear from anyone on this)?  I don't see how Cinema Black would have any effect on side bars.  The M series has no uniformity issues whatsoever and both the top and bottom bars look great but its poor video processing is a deal killer for me.  It sounds like blooming is less noticeable on the H8000 but probably at the cost of effective contrast.  The F8500 suits my needs the best but it's base design will not work in my bedroom. "

Honest officer, it was too dark to see anything.  I did, early on, reduce the backlight level to 10, IIRC, based on comments here...  I recall, either here, or one of the other threads I've been reading that for the fault finders once they search and find something then they can't \"unsee\" it (to paraphrase whatever they actually wrote). So I sit back and relax, watch, and enjoy the movie.  I hope some of the more expert folks can give you a better answer. "

They also have free shipping and a 60 money  back guarantee. You also get lifetime technical support at no extra cost. I have bought 4 televisions from them and every one arrived in perfect condition. They use UPS freight for shipping.  Depending on where you live, shipping takes 2 to 3 days. Visit their site and call them. You can place your order over the phone which is the way I ordered mine. They are a first class operation and will answer any questions you might have. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.  "

		"description": "   Ok the auto switching my receiver to TV input is really starting to piss me off.  I switched off of the ARC HDMI input and hooked up the TV to the receiver with an optical cable thinking it was ARC triggering my receiver to switch inputs.   Even after doing this is STILL switches inputs when I turn the TV on.  The only way to get it to stop is to disable Anynet+ completely but that obviously kills all of the convenience of it as well.   Also when disabled there's no TV Speaker \"off\" option that I can find?  I just have to turn the volume all the way down?   Stupid.......  Anyone have any better luck with this than me?  On a weird side note when Anynet+ is on my receiver shows the input signal is Dolby Digital but when it's off its PCM?  I have my Xfinity box set to \"surround\"?  How is that even possible when the audio source is the same and not from the TV?!?!   I'm so confused!  Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk "

I watch movies with my projector but I use my HDTV (32\" Samsung 32F6300) on a daily basis to play video games (both with my PC and my PS4) and to watch movies when I don't want to use my home theater. Since I actually enjoy both activities (video games &amp; movie watching) I've been thinking about the possibility to upgrade my TV and went looking for the LG 55\" 4K OLED TV. The cons I read were enough to put me away for paying that much for a non \"perfect\" TV for my uses and then I read about the 55\" UN55H8000 HDTV.  I have some quick questions for the owners of this HDTV that I would be very grateful if you gave me your insight:  1. I've seen that many people here play video games with the 55H8000 and they talk about the immersive feeling the curved display gives. If I don't notice any lag whatsoever with my 32\" Samsung 32F6300 when playing video games to the point that I don't even use the GAME MODE, should I be fine with the 55H8000? (I play mostly games like GTA 5, Watch Dogs, COD and driving games like Grid 2). I plan to use the 55H8000 on the same room I have the 32\" and seat reasonably closer like 5.4 - 6 foot to play video games.  2. Being that my TV is said 32\" Samsung 32F6300 (that's the 6000 series) would I get a best picture quality with the 55H8000 when watching movies? By better I mean better colors rendition, better blacks and contrast and overall and improvement so I could notice the difference from my former TV?  3. For \"just\" about $300 more I could get the 55\" 4K Samsung HU8700 TV or even pay less for the 4K HU7250 TV. I know 4K it's supposed to be \"better\" BUT if ALL my content will be at 1080p because I don't forth see a lot of 4K content in both video games and movies in the next 2-3 years, if I were to play said 1080p content on any of those 4K TV would I get the same or better image of the H8000 TV? Is it true the 4K TVs produces more input lag than a 1080p? I read some place that a 4K TV actually UPSCALES the 1080p content to an almost 4K content so if that it's true the 4K TV would be a no brainer...  4. Last question: Amazon.com is selling the UN55H8000 at US$1997,99. Do you think this price could go lower at Black Friday? Being that this HDTV seems to be a very popular model I wouldn't like to wait until Black Friday to see if the price can go lower and then realize that not only did the price didn't went low but that the TV went into unavailability.  Thank you a lot for your help! Much appreciated!      "

Just to quick questions: I read a review saying that even though the 55H8000 is a great TV, you could get the same results with the lower price Samsung H7150 even though I have make a specs comparison between those 2 models and the H8000 was Micro Dimming Ultimate and the H7150 has Micro Dimming Pro and the H8000 has CMR of 1200 and the H7150 of 960 and I like the curved model because I will use these TV (the H8000) only for myself for playing video games and watching some movies that my family don't like so I can be seated near and at the perfect center. So does buying the H8000 over the H7150 makes sense?  The second and last question is in comparison with the 55\" HU8700 &amp; HU8550 because I read a review saying that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal those 4K TVs is quite good and you can see every detail but on the other hand I have read other reviews and post saying that the upscaling a 4K TV does degrades or makes blurry the 1080p image and introduceds lag. The H8000 has the better ms response rate in gaming and said 4K models are worst but if it could be true that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal actually creates a better looking image the H8000 would provide it could make some sense to buy the 4K model.  What do you think? Thank you!!! "

I remember just last year the thought of buying the top of the line Samsung Series (8000 Series) was just of a thought because of the high price and now we can buy at a reasonable price what seems to be one of the best 1080 HDTV ever.

		"description": "   Honestly you got lucky.  It's better that a good tech replace the panel than receive a whole new TV.   Almost all clouding and flashlighting is caused by overtightening of the screws that secure the panel.  This tech probably could have got your existing panel looking good by loosening and retightening the panel screws to the proper spec all the way around.  Sounds like he did a good job installing the new panel.  If you have any residual clouding you can probably massage it out with a microfiber cloth.  Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk "

At $1884, it's still over $700 cheaper than most other places. My viewing distance is 8' so initially I wanted a 55\" but the 65\" is actually cheaper right now. I'm worried about the picture quality at 8' away. Does anyone else sit relatively close to their 65\"?  BTW, it looks like Best Buys are getting rid of their display models so you might be able to pick up an open box one. I saw one for $2398. "

Netflix works fine and the other apps that require internet connection.  My tv is hardwired to my router and i check all the time my internet connection  is very good. I've  been very disappointed  with the performance  of this tv with those two apps. YouTube and web browser are among  the TV's best features.  If you use the mutli view thing you would except it to work good. I had an f8000 and i never experienced  this problem before and this tv is sopose to be 2 times faster and better with the quad core plus. I know in the beginning  i had problems with the screensaver and that was fix with a firmware update. I had the motherboard  replaced twice now so I'm  wondering if its a universal  problem. "

		"description": "   Okay, just got my new UN65H800! Quite happy with it so far, but noticeable black uniformity issues unless Smart LED is turned on.  I run my blu ray player and my PC through my Denon receiver, through HDMI to the TV. When I name this source \"PC\" then switch sources on the receiver from actual PC to blu ray, the TV somehow knows these inputs are different and will save different picture settings for each. This is nice, and would be perfect if PC mode allowed Smart LED to be activated. I use my PC for games, and the flashlighting turns up more in games than it does in movies it seems (loading screens, etc.).  Otherwise, if I name that source on the TV \"game\" or \"AV Receiver\", whatever picture settings I set are global for that TV source, regardless if I change the Denon's source. This is annoying since I'd want to use something like game mode, and different sharpness settings for when the Denon's source is my PC vs movie settings for when the Denon's source is my blu ray.  Any ideas? "

Smart LED introduces its own visual artifacts with the backlight level changing in a vertical row with the non-black pixels.

Do you watch more in the dark or with ambient light?  I'm getting the 65\" next week and I was/am worried about the local dimming in the dark being to aggressive with the backlight.  Is it something that would give me fits watching Harry Potter, (a lot of dark scenes), in the dark with no lights? "

I don't necessarily like the curve but it's very subtle and the alternative doesn't compete with the PQ.       Several decades ago I started wearing progressive lenses in my glasses and I know some folks couldn't get comfortable with them... what I noticed was that they introduced a curve, similar to what I see on my H8000. Fortunately the progressive lenses didn't bother me and I'm fine with the curve on my Samsung but maybe some folks just won't feel comfortable with the curve. No right or wrong or which is best except for each individual, IMO. It does have processing that increases contrast(?) on objects determined to be closer to the viewer adding a sense of depth and this kinda pulls me into the picture. YVMV  I was looking at the 55H7150 at first and after seeing the 55H8000 I kept coming back to it so I finally decided to go with it, fortunately I'm quite happy with my choice. If its easy to return then that makes taking a chance a bit easier... I suspect either one would have been okay because I wouldn't be comparing them continually  I mostly just enjoy the picture and as someone else posted, don't recall if it was on this thread, once they found a problem they couldn't not see it. So if its not readily noticable I'll enjoy the picture. I did lower the backlight to around 10 which seemed better for me.  And while I have the 55H8000 I noticed with my latest prescription the magnification factor is such that I see an image roughly a foot wider... so I get a ~ a 65+\" view for the price of the 55\" model "

I bought a 55\" Sony x850b but it was returned due to panel problems. The day I returned it I set up the 46\" and immediately noticed the difference between 46\" and 55\". The 55\" was much easier on my 68 year old eyes.  I'm going to get the un55h8000 and the 46\" Sony will be relegated to bedroom duties.  BTW, I too am retired. "

		"description": "   This is the first time I have read the entire thread for a specific model tv and I can honestly say I'm impressed with 95% of the responses. Nearly all of you who own either the 55\" or the 65\" are reporting great uniformity, very little clouding/flashlighting and very good black levels. It doesn't seem to matter which panel(tdxx/tsxx) you have as both seem to be pretty good.  There has been some complaints pertaining to input lag, but I'm assuming it has to do with gaming. I'm not a gamer so that wouldn't bother me. I don't care about 3d either.  The only Samsung tv I've had was the UN46B8500 full array local dimming. Alas that tv developed a panel problem(vertical multi-colored lines on half of the panel). I had it repaired under warranty but it was never the same . That was in 2011 and I've stayed away from Samsung since  The only other brand I've owned is Sony(kdl46nx720 still going strong). I recently bought an xbr55x850b 4k Sony in early July and returned it after a week because of horrible clouding/flashlighting. A replacement was sent and two weeks later it was also returned for the same issues(refund).  I would like to say that because of all of the positive responses concerning the H8000 I strongly believe that i'm going to give Samsung another shot. My preferred place of purchase is Crutchfield. If the Sammy doesn't work out they have a 60 day money back guarantee.  Wish me luck  "

While I like the added pixel and what the future may hold for 4k I can't help but feel the H8000 is the way to go since 90% percent of usage will be PS4 gaming. I love the curve and the price for the 55\" of both models fall well in line with one another, so make the leap or stick with flagship 1080p. Oh and having the NX720,man that is a beautiful display and I wish mine hadn't died on me. "

I was VERY leary about getting a SAMSUNG..I have Panasonic Plasma (that I love) &amp; an older Mitshubishi LCD.  I LOVE the 3D on this.  I LOVE the SMARTness and the apps.   I think the picture is good, but Damn it needs a real tune (mine is in the basement and its darker down there...LOL).  I do have setting that I can live with.   I have tried many tunes.  I have tried some in this thread.  I think its best to use the \"auto\" setting for the 10-point.  Bottom line for me is that my AVR equipment is not playing friendly with it (that bugs the living crap out of me).   Samsung must HATE Pioneer or vice-versa.  To me it's a travesty that this TV wants to force the use of an optical connection to my SC-72 (SC-72 is a 2013 receiver and an awesome one at that).  I have switched the receiver to allow ARC...I have played with the DVI HDMI input and other video conversion settings on my receiver and this TV just will not support true HDMI discovery/ARC with my Pioneer.  I will NOT use an Optical cable to make it happy.  Instead I have to move the input manually to get them all to \"play nice in the sand box\".   My Panasonic sure had no issues with Pioneer!!!   I am on the fence about taking this back...I like the TV.  My Pioneer BDP-62FD Blu-Ray gets detected by the TV and will auto switch to the proper input, but its slow and you see the stupid on-screen msg about the source not present (that's crap and SLOW!).  Also when watching a BD the 16:9 black bars sometimes go in and out between \"full screen\" while playing the same movie.  I want \"full\" not black bars.  Cant seem to get that sorted even with the SmartBD option turned off.   Basically, I will be calling Pioneer, but I think it's the TV.  If I have to hook up an optical just to get the units to talk outside of pure HDMI then I say \"F\" this TV!!!  I surely value my Pioneer elite AVR better than the TV!   I have all HDMI 2.0 high end cables.   BTW: If you want to reset this TV back to \"out of box settings\" then you need the PIN number.  I called Samsung last night.  the PIN is 0000 (4 zeros).   If I can get the thing to like Pioneer then I am keeping it...it is a nice picture when It wants to be.  I still want real tune settings for a dark room however,   Sorry for the long read, but please someone \"help\" me with the Pioneer stuff and I will love this TV.   I also have a PS4 and it works with Game mode on or off, but Game mode seems better. "

		"description": "   I am guessing (hoping) Pioneer can help.  If I try to use true ARC and hook Verizon, PS4, and BD to TV, then take TV to SC-72 I would only get Dolby 5.1 from Apps and get 2.0 from PCM(also would require optical as well) instead of full 7.1 HD sound with one HDMI.  I realize I can switch receiver to an input and get both via an HDMI, but TV wont allow it automatically without conversion that will create input-lag that will make video and audio suffer for different things(IE: video lag to great for games &amp; Audio would not be HD to allow for proper streamed video).  I also still have no idea how to make the Input on this H8000 be PC???  Does anyone know if I can use the Receiver's 2 separate HDMI \"outputs\" go to TV instead of TV to AVR \"Inputs\"?  That way I would have audio and video HDMI split?  I am not a pro here by any means. "

Might be a little different with the 240Hz Panel on the h8000 but the 7150 also has a 240Hz panel and a lot of people have complained about jerkiness to the picture on anything but clear. "

I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy. "

There's not a wide variety of panels with the h8000.  65\" has TD01/02 and 55\"/ 46\" have TS01/02.  I've been looking at the 65\" for a while now but keep hearing about slight uniformity issues.  I'm seriously considering the LG55EC9300 OLED that recently came out but really scared of Burn-in/Image Retention. "

Interested to see what the next one will be  I feel like the lower right portion of my panel was just slightly over tightened.  I bet if it were backed off a quarter turn it would be perfect.  If the new one isn't any better I'll place a call to samsung and see if they are willing to send out a technician to try and adjust the panel or replace it until we get one that's suitable.   I was looking at the LG OLED as well but the first amazon review scared me a bit with the bad motion judder under certain situations.  Granted this could probably be fixed with a firmware update but....... ya never know.   I wouldn't be so much worried about IR as it doesn't seem to be an issue.  I'm a long time plasma advocate and if that was manageable I'm sure OLED is even better.   If it were 65\" I'd be all over it.  I'm coming from a 55 and really wanted 65 or larger which I why I was sold on the H8000.   If it weren't for some QC issues I have read about on the F8500 it would have been the clear choice for me.

The sound is actually quite good although it will benefit greatly from a soundbar/subwoofer system. Standard definition programming through dish network is the best I've ever seen. High definition is out of this world as is blu-ray.  Regarding the curved screen, it took me all of two minutes getting used to it. The curve is very subtle and does provide slightly better off angle viewing. The curvature of the stand is greater than that of the tv itself so it's my thinking that it makes getting used to the curved screen easier.  I'll tinker with the settings over the next few days, but right now I'm going to sit back and enjoy this wonderful tv.  To say I'm happy would be an understatement Well done Samsung. "

If the new one isn't any better I'll place a call to samsung and see if they are willing to send out a technician to try and adjust the panel or replace it until we get one that's suitable.   I was looking at the LG OLED as well but the first amazon review scared me a bit with the bad motion judder under certain situations.  Granted this could probably be fixed with a firmware update but....... ya never know.   I wouldn't be so much worried about IR as it doesn't seem to be an issue.  I'm a long time plasma advocate and if that was manageable I'm sure OLED is even better.   If it were 65\" I'd be all over it.  I'm coming from a 55 and really wanted 65 or larger which I why I was sold on the H8000.   If it weren't for some QC issues I have read about on the F8500 it would have been the clear choice for me. Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk       Did the Flashlighting go away at all with Local Dimming on High?  The LG OLED, (9300), just got a firmware update that supposedly fixed the motion issues.  But, the issues were mainly with owners not activating the Tru-Motion, or whatever LG calls their motion settings, while watching blu rays with a 24/1080p film cadence.  Once turned on, there were no issues but obviously introduced Soap Opera Effect.  New update fixed it. "

		"description": "   Hi All,  I've only ever had Sony's and most recently bought a 65\" X9 4k. The set is amazing in every regard EXCEPT motion resolution. It's ok for tv and films but awful for video games. I suspect this is a combination of high lcd latency and upscaling. Game mode has low input lag but the motion blur is terrible when playing FPS'. I play with interpolation turned on and it helps a good bit but it's still pretty bad, especially on 30fps games, and lag is way up.  So, I'm selling the TV, which is heartbreaking. I use my tv primarily for games and can't deal with the blur. My sony from 2010 was much better in terms of motion but the picture was obviously not nearly as good. I'm seriously considering the Samsung h8000 because my understanding is that Samsung's in general have better motion handling and this particular set is best.  My question is for gamers. What is the motion blur like in game mode and have you played with AMP on? Is it better with a tolerable latency? I don't play competitively so even 100ms doesn't bother me. But motion blur kills the experience. Many gamers said they thought the x9 was great for gaming, but clearly they're not sensitive to blur. I'd love to get some candid responses regarding motion blur and gaming on this set. Thanks!  Jason "

Burn in just isn't going to happen. Ever. One of the reasons plasmas are going off of the market is due to the burn in resistance of LCDs. And there is nothing different about the Samsung panel that makes it more susceptible.  Trust me, don't think twice about it. I've had lcd monitors playing the same content on loops for years on end without issue (demo material). And if it were an issue, there would be no tv on the market that anyone could buy.  It's entirely possible that language is just a hold over from the manual the company did for their plasma and no-one thought to take it out. "

After reading most of the H7150 posts it seems it's hit or miss with uniformity problems.  Even among Samsung Panels, (TS01/TH01).  I think a lot of the 7150 owners who claim their set is relatively blemish free are not sure what uniformity is or aren't obsessing over it because there are quite a few reports of Flashlighting and clouding on the S-PVA Panels.       I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy.       How is the Flashlighting on the 8000 in a dark room? "

Are you referring to auto dimming or local?  Auto dimming will dim the entire picture on darker scenes to give the effect of deeper blacks.  There's usually no setting to change if your TV is equipped with it.  Local Dimming dims just the darker sections, or zones, of the picture, leaving the rest of the scene alone.  It's usually referred to as Smart LED on Samsung Sets and there's a high/low setting.   Anyone with a 65\" H8000 have a TS01 Panel or are they only TD01 Panels?  Do the H8000 Owners with clouding/uniformity problems have U.S. Versions with Local Dimming activated or is it just bad luck? "

The dimming definitely helps hide the problem but like stated earlier I'd rather not have to mask an obvious issue.  Sounds like the LG is a contender for sure then!  Wish I could see one in person somewhere.  I bet it looks amazing.  OLED is definitely the future of televisions.  Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk "

It's easy to notice on a shot that pans from ultra bright to ultra dark.

It's entirely possible that language is just a hold over from the manual the company did for their plasma and no-one thought to take it out.       That eases my mind. I only posted that info because I had a plasma that did develop  image retention and some minor burn-in. Like I said, I've had my Sony 46nx720 for 3+ years and never noticed any image retention or burn-in and my tv is on constantly.  Thanks for your response. "

It really weird, then after a while, the input lag goes back 50ms, i have even hit 90ms while in game mode. It so inconsistant and not sure what to do about this.. That the only thing bugging me with this tv, otherwise the image is perfect for me.  i also notice that when i shut down the tv and put it back on, the input lag will also vary, it like something is working in background cause the variation  ( Sorry english is not my main language ) "

My UN46D7000 completely gave out and after a lengthy warranty process with Samsung (initiated back in February) they will be delivering the unit shortly. I had the option between this model and the H7150, and chose the larger 48\" curved over the older flat display. Does anyone have any advice upon receipt of the unit? I plan on using my existing wall mount, is that ill-advised? "

After reading lots of posts here I did go in thinking I'd probably buy the 55H7150 but watching both for a while pushed me to the 8000 even at an additional $400.  When I told the sales rep at Best Buy that I wanted a Samsung panel he had no idea that some sets didn't use Samsung panels, nor did the guy that delivered and set it up. Happily it came with a TS02.  I've been without a TV for 14 years and finally recycled the massive, 225 pound Sony monitor, and old electronics to make way for a new setup. I only watch DVDs and Blu-Ray movies on it. Love the picture. I did turn the backlight down to 10.  I think the sound on the set is pretty good for a TV but it is weak in the low end, no shaking the walls. I remembered that my BD player has audio out jacks and one of them is a sub-woofer output so i plugged in my Velodyne sub-woofer built in 1991. Much nicer. I had to put a new foam surround on it as it self destructed on my first movie, Ender's Game. The foam was rotted. Found a repair kit at a company in Southern California. Cost $40 with tax and postage. Sounds great.  Looking to get a Marantz NR1605 for the time being, as the budget is a bit tight after the cost of the TV ;-) "

Right now I have the Panasonic DMP-BDT500, but might need to replace it soon as I'm starting to get strange artifacts on the right side of my screen on certain movies. Thought at first it was the movies, but tried a friends player and didn't get it. Let me know how you like the Sammy blu-ray player. Might look into that one myself. Let me know how well it handels 3D as well, as that is something I do like and one of the reasons I went with the bd-t500.       Hi Joseph,  This is a late reply but I just recently signed on with AVS Forums.  I watched Prometheus in 3D on my BD-F7500 and thought it did pretty well. The glasses bother some folks eyes or cause headaches but I did alright. I remember 3D movies in the 1950s and never had a problem with them either.  I also tried the 2D &gt; 3D option and it added a bit of depth but not as much as a 3D disk.  The glasses are a bit like sunglasses and make the picture darker which I  don't care for. "

		"description": "     My son plays with a PS3 and a PS4;  he says that there is a noticeable difference when using game mode. Maybe as much as a 1/2 second difference.  Just his thoughts, not measured at all. The PS4 must be turned on to be recognized before game mode can be selected. The PS4 is in HDMI 2.  We received the 48 inch version of the TV yesterday. So too early for a considered evaluation.  But, initial thoughts are very positive. I have scoured this forum for a couple of weeks. I had never heard of all the things that can go wrong with an LED screen. Clouding, flashlighting,  light bleed, banding, oh my!!!!  From what I have seen so far and after looking for it with a black screen at night and dark scenes at night, I have panel TS01 and I have not seen any such issues yet.  I went from my CRT Sony Trinitron Wega 1080i 36 inch. I loved that tv. But, after 8 years it died.  I planned to get a Sony as I have only had a Sony for over thirty years. My husband is still watching and enjoying a 2003 Sony XBR LCD!  But, after much research reading reviews and this forum, I decided on this Samsung H8000.    It made the list of 10 best televisions in the world as did a couple of Sony televisions.  Right out of the box, the picture is crisp, no motion issues,  colors are great, skin tones look natural, and the black levels are very dark with no light bleed at all. Right out of the box in standard picture mode, it is almost perfect for me. We tweaked the settings very slightly in standard mode.  I put sound on clear voice mode.  The only trouble I am having at all is voice recognition when trying to use voice interaction.  I was actually sad to not get a Sony, seriously almost 1/2 my life with a Sony tv!!!  But, this tv is amazing to me and is far superior in picture quality to my 2006 CRT. And, to the 2003 Sony XBR, granted that Sony is an older tv. "

I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don't have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000's must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask!       Just the post I was looking for.  I'm looking to upgrade from my LN52A860 (the set that made me fall in love with Samsungs)  but I've been torn after looking at articles on the top gaming TVs.  I really don't want to go back to a Sony. I have no idea what the input lag is on my LN52A860 but I was hoping to improve on it. There is no game mode on the LN52A860 (that I know of). It looks like the only real option from 2014 Samsung models is the H800s. I'm torn between the 55\" or 65\" but my main concern is if the 34-37ms lag is still going to be noticeable. I couldn't find any info on how the LN52A860 rated with input lag so I don't really have any comparison. My other question is how does turning on game mode effect the picture quality? "

The 7150 base would have been too wide for my stand which would have required the purchase of a new stand. The 8000 fit on the one I already had which allowed me to put that money into the TV instead of having to buy a new stand or pay to have it mounted (That's the way I rationalized it out anyway). "

The Bad: It doesn't have as deep a black level as a plasma; it suffers from a slight red push; it has a reflective screen; Yahoo apps aren't very slick; and the remote sensor isn't very responsive. The Bottom Line: The Vizio M-Series offers a potent combination of excellent design, decent picture quality, and a pocket-friendly price.'  You get what you pay for.  If your satisfied with a little less picture quality and apps, a little lower quality of the passive 3D image, a picture that doesn't pop like it's cheaper E-Series TV, then you are welcome to buy a lower quality set.  Good picture, but not better than a Samsung. "

I am amped for the P-series Vizio right now, but share the same concerns with Vizio use of the term full array. I have owned the HX929 from Sony and that was a hell of a set. While H8000 is an edge based dimmer, samsung has a rather impressive implementation. I am optimistic for the P-series, but will likely end up with the H8000 @ 1080p or the HU7250 (curved) or HU8550 (flat)@ 4k. "

The US Version should have a HIGH setting and a LOW setting for dimming. Sorry if I'm coming off rude but I'm planning on getting this set or the OLED from LG.

Samsung seems to get \"Movie Mode\" really well. I'm not going to say it's set to D6500K, but its damn good. :) When I set it to movie mode I didn't have to play with much... Turned down the backlight, contrast, brightness. Turned off all the picture \"enhancements\" (dynamic contrast, Black tone...) I do use Smart LED , and Cinema Black (just helps to keep black bars \"black\" if a movie has it) But yeah... Very solid picture!\u00a0  "

You should be good with that blu-ray player. Right now I have the Panasonic DMP-BDT500, but might need to replace it soon as I'm starting to get strange artifacts on the right side of my screen on certain movies. Thought at first it was the movies, but tried a friends player and didn't get it. Let me know how you like the Sammy blu-ray player. Might look into that one myself. Let me know how well it handels 3D as well, as that is something I do like and one of the reasons I went with the bd-t500. "

Not trying to bash kwcanuck, Cheers to you kwcanuck!

Results in display mages that are high contrast grayed out, 100% no pop, no\u00a0clarity, greyed out blacks, etc, zero sharpness. Nothing with these settings look anything but old CRT from 1980, nothing as expected with H8000. I prefer\u00a0factory DYNAMIC\u00a0with minor change below with blu ray 1080P\u00a0source.\u00a0 \u00a0 I did modify a few H8000 settings as follows, YRMV: SOUND, Amplify TV SOUND OUTPUT, Stand AMP CUSTOM, 5, 6, OFF CLEAR VU, High DYNAMIC, no other changes Source blu ray set 1080P (this disables BD WISE) I do not like DYNAMIC for OTA broadcast; will choose something at another time for OTA viewing.Today out of the box my interest was blu ray. My H8000 has no banding or other issues to\u00a0image/LED display/image processing as tested over 9 hours. \u00a0 Demo blu ray disc and chapters: Prometheus 1, 25, 35 Alice in Wonderland 6 Inception 11 Sky Fall 3, 11, 17 Attack of the Clones 26, 28 Avatar 1 The Hobbit 26, 34, 44 Ghost Protocol 10 I\u00a0didn't\u00a0demo any\u00a03D yet. YouTube various vids streaming 4K, selected 1080p (from drop down box on streaming vid) Various\u00a0moving\u00a0animals Various cities like London high speed \u00a0 My last display was LCD Samsung LN52a850 calibrated. \u00a0 So... the H8000 with blu ray 1080p, YouTube\u00a0Wi-Fi stream\u00a04k in 1080p\u00a0(drop down box) all\u00a0vids demos IMO are stunning, easily reference quality. Clear image\u00a0movement with very minimal\u00a0artifacts, HQ color saturation, ultra clean &amp; clear images, reference quality performance\u00a0like Samsung display\u00a0at 14\u00a0CES (Consumer Electronics Show exhibit) I'm a CES attendee 29 years. I chose H8000 over HU9000 due to limited 4k content and, expect to buy a 4096k set sometime when both content and true 4k display at reasonable cost will release 4-5 years from now,\u00a0tic toc. \u00a0   screen shot from Samsung GS3, paused image looks superior to this image.

I prefer\u00a0factory DYNAMIC\u00a0with minor change below with blu ray 1080P\u00a0source.\u00a0 \u00a0 I did modify a few H8000 settings as follows, YRMV: SOUND, Amplify TV SOUND OUTPUT, Stand AMP CUSTOM, 5, 6, OFF CLEAR VU, High DYNAMIC, no other changes Source blu ray set 1080P (this disables BD WISE) I do not like DYNAMIC for OTA broadcast; will choose something at another time for OTA viewing.Today out of the box my interest was blu ray. My H8000 has no banding or other issues to\u00a0image/LED display/image processing as tested over 9 hours. \u00a0 Demo blu ray disc and chapters: Prometheus 1, 25, 35 Alice in Wonderland 6 Inception 11 Sky Fall 3, 11, 17 Attack of the Clones 26, 28 Avatar 1 The Hobbit 26, 34, 44 Ghost Protocol 10 I\u00a0didn't\u00a0demo any\u00a03D yet. YouTube various vids streaming 4K, selected 1080p (from drop down box on streaming vid) Various\u00a0moving\u00a0animals Various cities like London high speed \u00a0 My last display was LCD Samsung LN52a850 calibrated. \u00a0 So... the H8000 with blu ray 1080p, YouTube\u00a0Wi-Fi stream\u00a04k in 1080p\u00a0(drop down box) all\u00a0vids demos IMO are stunning, easily reference quality. Clear image\u00a0movement with very minimal\u00a0artifacts, HQ color saturation, ultra clean &amp; clear images, reference quality performance\u00a0like Samsung display\u00a0at 14\u00a0CES (Consumer Electronics Show exhibit) I'm a CES attendee 29 years. I chose H8000 over HU9000 due to limited 4k content and, expect to buy a 4096k set sometime when both content and true 4k display at reasonable cost will release 4-5 years from now,\u00a0tic toc. \u00a0   screen shot from Samsung GS3, paused image looks superior to this image.   Great post! I am loving this TV as well! Some people have stated its a F8000 with a curve... I went through 7 of those at Best Buy and I can say with certainty it is FAR better! I couldn't post a pic that shows the true quality of this panel either. lol Though I tried. "

Will try this TV for 1 more week, if it continues to have problems then it is going back to store Samsung customer service could not tell me if this TV hasBluetooth LE (4.0) CPU Speed (quad core plus means what?) Total Ram (not flash storage)  It currently says 349.8 MB used out of 1.22 GB If anyone knows these specifications, kindly reply.EDIT: Jun 4, 2014 Netflix problem was resolved after talking to netflix support. BTW if you want to go into service menu, the code is Press Mute followed by 1, 8, 2, PWR, the TV will shutdown and restart with Service menu overlay. Be EXTREMELY careful playing around with service menu, there are several posts on AVS forum where people have bricked their sets after changing values. - Have successfully paired Logitech Bluetooth keyboard however most of the apps do not support keyboard for text entry. - This TV does NOT allow Bluetooth audio playback. (Actually none of the smart TV sets support it, this was confirmed by Samsung customer service) Samsung recommends connecting wireless headsets to Audio out port. I am fairly happy with the set after fixing Netflix glitch. The disappointments are (not necessarily with Samsung): 1. Lack of Bluetooth audio I cannot understand why samsung could not put an audio driver for the BT chipset, they support keyboard, mouse, smart remote via bluetooth so why not AUDIO!! IMHO it was a very stupid decision by TV department to exclude BT Audio. 2. APPS a) Apps do not have consistent data entry i.e. very few apps support smart remote, for others you have to use regular remote. It is very frustrating to juggle between two remotes, netflix supports smart remote but almost every other app I have tried requires the use of regular remote with Red, Blue, Green and Yellow keys. b) Keyboard panel in apps for text entry is not consistent E.G. Netflix - The Login Id/Passwd uses regular QWERTY mode but for searching it switches to ABCD mode! This is a samsung issue though because their SDK should NOT expect app developers to fiddle with keyboard layout. c) The weather channel: If you can setup multiple locations without cursing the app then you have far more patience than me d) TV/Movies Section It would tell you if a show is available on Vudu or Hulu to rent/buy but will not show if it is available on netflix or Amazon. How can it not connect to netflix or amazon using their API to search? e) Removing Apps If anyone finds out how to remove pre-installed apps then please let me know e.g. M2Go Samsung App panel developers, please get your act together!! Don't get me wrong, I am fairly happy with the \"TV\" but when I am buying a Smart TV, I expected a bit more polished experience. Feel free to ask any other questions. "

However the Smart Hub firmware has bugs!, I have rebooted this TV 5 times in last week since I purchased it.1st Issue: (2nd day) Had connected this TV via ethernet but it lost connection to network, removed ethernet and tried via wireless but it could not be fixed, even by resetting the Smart Hub, had to power it off as per instructions from customer support. User guide says that Cat 7 ethernet cables are required but I only have Cat 5e cables so will have to try later with Cat 7.2nd Issue: (3rd day) The wifi lost internet connection, was not resolved by resetting smart hub however resetting the TV fixed it.3rd issue: (6th day) The netflix app stopped working, resetting smart hub did not fix it but resetting the TV fixed it. Will try this TV for 1 more week, if it continues to have problems then it is going back to store\u00a0 Samsung customer service could not tell me if this TV has Bluetooth LE (4.0) CPU Speed (quad core plus means what?) Total Ram (not flash storage)  If anyone knows these specifications, kindly reply.  The positive in this is that the software can be fixed. \u00a0It sounds like the hardware (picture) is pretty good. \u00a0What size did you go with? \u00a0 Samsung says this about their processor:\u00a0 Quote:  Enjoy a smoother Smart TV experience with a powerful Quad Core Plus processor. More than twice as fast as a Quad Core processor, it delivers smoother and faster navigation and multitasking for web browsing, switching between content and more.   \u00a0 It sounds like it is a faster clock speed on the CPU. \u00a0 \u00a0 I haven't heard anything about bluetooth in my research. \u00a0I also haven't found anything related to how much RAM   "

For those that had no issues even with it turned off I guess it may have been luck of the draw. I know I was pretty unlucky with my first 60in 7100 and 2 Sony 850As. But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.  \u00a0 So we're on the same page: Smart LED feature == \"Precision Black\" == local dimming Micro Dimming Ultimate == software-based video processing. It's not really local dimming of the LEDs at all. \u00a0 The US versions\u00a0of the\u00a0F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate as well as\u00a0Precision Black local dimming. The UK and\u00a0Canadian versions of the F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate, but NOT Precision Black local dimming. \u00a0 The UK version of the H8000 that was reviewed has no hardware-based local dimming. It's an actual difference in the hardware, not just software. To make things more confusing, the Canadian H8000 webpage says \"Precision Black (Local Dimming) Available\". So there's probably two different versions of the TV in Canada. \u00a0 That\u00a0AVForums H8000 review\u00a0is a bit confusing: \"The also H8000 doesn't include Samsung's Smart LED feature which is a shame because it really helps with the perceived blacks but its absence is consistent with last year's F8000 model. However the local dimming was very effective, expertly handling our usual assortment of torture tests.\"\u00a0They seem\u00a0to imply that the UK H8000 they tested has local dimming, which it doesn't. I'm guessing they were actually referring to F8000 and the fact that its local dimming is effective. \u00a0 FWIW, my Canadian UN55F8000, which has no local dimming, has no issues with uniformity.  "

		"description": "   Regarding your question about gaming mode on the H8000. The review on avforums indicated:\u201cThe H8000 delivered a sizeable input lag of 120ms when in the calibrated Movie mode but thankfully things improved dramatically when the Game mode was selected. This brought the input lag down to 34ms which whilst not the lowest we've measured - Sony appear to be the leaders in this area at the moment - should be low enough for all but the most demanding of gamers. Unlike the HU8500, renaming the input didn't make any difference to the lag but 34ms is amongst the best we have measured recently. Certainly we didn't notice any appreciable delay when gaming on the H8000 and overall we found it to be quite responsive, although our reactions might not be as cat-like as many others. If you sat quite close to the display, the curved nature of the screen could also help to make the gaming experience slightly more immersive\u201d. This review indicated the input lag in Gaming mode is identical to that specified in the avforums review:\"Samsung has reduced the input lag on the 55H8000 compared with last year\u2019s 55F8000, though it\u2019s still behind the class-leading Sony Bravias. Our Leo Bodnar input lag tester returned a figure of 34ms in [Game] mode; and a much less gaming-friendly 119ms in [Movie] mode.\" This review recorded an input lag lower than 34ms:\"After the rather disappointing 60ms-plus input lag reading recorded on the UE65HU8500, it\u2019s great to see the UE55H8000 only hitting a much more gaming-friendly figure of 33ms.\"  The User Manual on the Canadian web site indicates that the television does indeed have a gaming mode. Further, the topic titled \u201cEnabling Game Mode\u201d provides instructions for accessing this feature. For your reference, here is the sequence: MENU &gt;System &gt; General &gt; Game Mode Try Now. There are a few warnings about Game Mode in the User Manual:Game Mode cannot be used for normal TV viewing. Connect the gaming console before enabling Game Mode. Otherwise, the picture quality may suffer. The screen may shake a little. Enabling Game Mode automatically sets the Picture Mode to Standard and the Sound Mode to Movie. To use a different external device, first disconnect the game console and disable Game Mode.  Hope this helps. Looking forward to more reviews. My 55H8000 arrives today. "

		"description": "   Good day everyone,  I purchased the 65H8000 this past weekend mainly for games. I was worried about the input lag. I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don't have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000's must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask! "

		"description": "   So I just got off the phone with Samsung Canada.  I can confirm that the Canadian model UN65H8000FZXC DOES have hardware based local Dimming.  You can't set it at any level, it's automatically on and there is NO level to control.  Subsequently, the US version has no option to control it either ( at least not in the entire manual )  So for all the Canadian customers, no one was left out, we do have it and on ALL screen sizes.  for the UK people, I would call to confirm if it's available.  I have the 65\" and I haven't had any issues with the black levels.  I am going to get it calibrated probably within the month, depending on the availability of the calibrator. "

Realistic ultra-clean, high quality, low noise images, excellent flesh tones, excellent detail, saturated color, deep inky black in every scene.  I believed (imagined otherwise) that both shows as listed looked as if the H8000 was monitoring at the show set live in the control booth. Both broadcast looked exceptional, reference quality.

Samsung seem to be the only company this year to have released an actual flagship 1080p set and Im curious how it stacks up, as it seemingly has essentially every single feature from the 9000, except \"purcolor\" and a drop from 1400 to 1200 MCR (though the 8000 has a 240hz native panel...) Putting aside 4k content, I wonder how the two would stack up when playing 1080p content... "

		"description": "   Hello. Did everyone leave? This thread has been quiet for a few days. Usually this is about the time people begin finding issues with their new toys and start complaining. But, apparently this television is different than the usual, and people are enjoying the new purchase. If this is true then this TV is worth the steep price tag. How difficult is it to place the stand assembly onto the set out of the box? I'm guessing that with the curved screen, extra care must be taken when laying it down to prevent damage. Or do you simply set the television down onto the stand upright, like the way Panny plasmas are stand mounted? Thanks guys congrats on your new sets. I have a Mits DLP that is starting to show signs of chip failure (specks/spots visible during dark scenes or when screen is blank/no input) so the 65 is looking like a prime replacement. Of course it's cheaper to fix, but 10,000:1 contrast ratio is a little passe these days. "

		"description": "   Sorry Everyone for not getting back sooner ... It's been overwhelming getting this unit set up and we love this TV so much now we can't stop watching / fiddling with it. \u00a0 It needs a minimal amount of tinkering out of the box - that's nothing new ...\u00a0After changing to 'Movie' mode, that was really all it took to get a decent picture that I watched all afternoon. \u00a0 Yea, we spent the whole entire afternoon watching French Open Tennis - Sorry! \u00a0 Then yesterday we had to go back to Best Buy (Canada) and buy a TV stand to go with it ... (Whalen BBCXL54-NV - Reg: $269.00 / Paid: $199.00) ... So, we spent the 2nd day putting that together and watching more TV (I'm an old retired guy so I need to take breaks)\u00a0 \u00a0 I did notice some motion judder / stuttering in the fast tennis action but it wasn't overly bad ... Just the same, I went to &lt;Auto Motion Plus&gt; under Picture --&gt; Options and changed the setting to &lt;Standard&gt; - I saw no more stuttering after that.\u00a0 \u00a0 Also, at first - the 65\" was kind of overwhelming even at 10 feet away ... coming from a 50\" Panasonic Viera plasma - Not a shabby TV either. In any case now with a viewing distance of 12' - I love it and don't think we'll ever go to the movie theater again. \u00a0 \u00a0 Just some facts and observations now ... \u00a0 Model: UN65H8000AFXZC / Panel: TS01 No dead / stuck pixels \u00a0 Best Buy: List Price - $3799.99 and includes a Samsung Galaxy TABPRO 10.1\" Tablet (worth $520.00) ... {FYI - This is expensive and was an ok deal ONLY because I wanted the TABPRO 10.1\" - 2560x1600} \u00a0 Measured Power: 2 Watts in STANDBY ... 145 Watts while ON ... Measured using the BluePlanet EM100 Energy Meter {FYI - The old Viera plasma ran between 480 - 550 Watts ... No kidding} \u00a0 Picture wise: It looks fabulous! ... However, I did notice some small back light bleed around the edge and some uneven lighting when viewing a black screen but take that with a grain of salt since I don't (yet) have a calibration disc so I can't be really sure of what I'm looking at and the thing is not totally set up yet. \u00a0 I did NOT notice any banding - none in any viewing done over these few days. \u00a0 One thing I can mention - I used HDMI-1 for Bell Satellite (PVR) and HDMI-2 for the Bluray player for movie viewing ... By default, the unit is configured to change settings on ALL inputs - change this to apply setting changes to affect only the input your viewing - If that's what you want ... I wasted a few hours tinkering with the Bluray for movies and went to the PVR input and tinkered there and lost all my Bluray settings - Argggh. \u00a0 Last word - I watched a few minutes of 'Lawrence of Arabia' on Bluray - I guess they can't make 'em like that any more - Anyway, the visuals are stunning but on this set they are jaw-dropping (My 2 cents) \u00a0 Let me know if you want any other info but it may take a while to report back - Once you turn on the H8000 Curved - It ain't easy to walk away.

This is emphasized by this statement taken from a review of an American specification television:The strongest in the market LED edge backlight and black levels really give this Samsung an edge in picture quality over every other LED TV in the market. The 55F8000 has best in class color and contrast that create superior images and the light flow through the the LED backlights is amazing. Images on screen are crisp, and refined compared to some of the other LED TVs out there. The backlight does need to be kept in check because it has the potential to wash colors and contrast out. The safe zone for the backlight setting on this TV is around 70% of capacity.  "

To quote this article, Game mode \"...isn't magic, nor does it simply overclock the processors and jack up the performance. Instead, it starts taking things out. Color processing, noise reduction, advanced scaling, all of these aspects and more get thrown out or greatly reduced\". So, the Game mode on the H8000 follows the industry standard to reduce input lag. There are a number of good articles available. Just Google Game Mode. "

		"description": "   I have now set up my H8000, and all I can say is \u201cwow\u201d. The unboxing indicated the care that Samsung take when packaging and shipping their products. The screen was very well protected and the all of the accessories were provided in a separate box. A cleaning cloth was provided, which I thought was a nice touch. The chrome accent strip around the screen and the stand were well protected with plastic film. I recently set up a new Sony television, and the Samsung experience provided a greater sense that someone was paying attention to the details. I have not had time to test the settings provided in a previous post, but picture quality in Movie mode is amazing. I played Master and Commander (an old favorite) tonight and it was stunning. SD video looks very good and Netflix movies look equally good. My only (minor) criticism is that the stand seems a little flimsy. Also, the screen seems prone to reflection from our floor lamps. Small issues. Overall, I would give this television an 8.5 or a 9 out of 10 for picture quality, construction, ease of operation, and features. Most of the reviews I have read to date seem to concur with this assessment. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from other owners. "

		"description": "   I got mine yesterday. 65 inch version. Big time white clouding in all four corners of the screen. It's there on every input and source. It's there on my Blu ray player, bell dish, etc. etc. I've tried different cables and did the factory reset. I  unplugged the unit for an hour. I'm out of options. The only way to make it less noticeable is to lower the contrast and backlight settings so low that it ruins the picture. I tried the cloth deal from above, it didn't help. I'll be calling Samsung Monday Morning. Outside of the clouding issue I really enjoyed the set. Set up was a breeze. That little smart remote which I'd thought I would hate is so easy to use. I love it. Picture for movies and sports was tremendous. Broadcast TV like fox and nbc with their 1 hour dramas were not nearly as good as film and sport. I'm going to put in moon goo's settings now and see what they are like. The TV is a breeze to assemble. Like pointed out earlier, stand is very flimsy. I make sure to hold on to set when plugging and pulling out cables. I paid 2900 Canadian cash for the set in Toronto before tax and warranty. That's it, that's all I got. What are the odds on this? The same day the cloudy :} tv arrives my bell 9242 pvr receiver starts to flame out. I can't record or pause anything and I lost 80 hours of recorded stuff. Live TV is working fine. "

Dark scenes look exceptionally natural and involving thanks to the TV's ability to produce a black colour that actually looks black, rather than some shade of grey like we still see on other LCD TVs\" One final thought: \"...if there's a better 55-inch full HD TV around this year I'd love to see it!\" "

I have not been able to find a solution to this annoying problem, but I'm hoping some of the experts in this forum might have recommendations. I was testing the 3D capability and I must say I was quite impressed, even though I'm not a big fan of 3D. Vivid colors and true depth. Stunning. "

Noticed clouding in the top a little to the side of the right corner, but with smart led + cinema black, it's completely gone when watching content  Color and blacks as well as motion are all superb in movie mode with some adjustments. It's a shame this TV has seemingly gone under the radar in favour of the 4Ks as I suspect if compared directly their real life performance would be close to the same. "

		"description": "   Ive been a Sony guy for the longest time, but there's some things here that are really changing my tune.  The cinema black feature is a godsend. Corner light bleed and flashlighting is something that's killed me on my 55W900 and on the 65X900Bs ive been looking at. The Cinema Black feature does an amazing job at keeping blacks pitch black on letter bars even in a pitch black room. Im shocked, I figured only OLED could cure this issue (plasma aside).  The local dimming is pretty crazy here as well, credits, in a pitch black room with smart led enabled, I barely see any light blooming whatsoever around the lettering, unlike the Sonys, and black levels overall are phenomenal (tested Prometheus, scenes set in space, star fields looked phenomenal considering this is edge lit).  Also, something minor, but with speakers set to audio out, there is no popup whatsoever when using my Samsung smart remote to control my external speaker.  Other than that, motion is on point, couldnt be happier with it, gaming performance on gaming mode is excellent, no noticeable lag.  This TV has it all. "

The only picture setting I don't like is dynamic. The other three settings are perfectly ok with me. I have been happy with mine since the day I got it and still haven't tweaked any settings except changing to the movie setting.  As far as your washed out colors, it may be your cable feed. Remember this saying? Garbage in, garbage out. Well it is definitely true and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  I think you should ask Amazon for an exchange and give the 55H8000 another chance. If you still aren't happy then you'll know that you didn't give up easily.  "

I really don't want to give up the black levels and uniformity but the picture is driving me nuts.  I have a rule of thumb, if i have to fiddle with settings for more than 5 minutes to get a good picture then there's something wrong with the TV.  I've had at least 10 high end and mid range tvs over the last 8 years, a few got returned, and the ones I kept took me 2-4 minutes to realize if it was good or not. "

The h6400 is mainly a failsafe if the 7150 doesn't work out.  Thanks for all the info over the last 6 months.       AA Sorry it didn't work out for you. I guess that's why they call it the panel lottery. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you don't. I hope whichever you decide on(7150 or 6400)works out for the best.  Good luck  "

Both looked great to me.  Looking at 2D immediately afterwards sure looks \"flat\"  Next 3D features in my lineup; Pacific Rim, Upside Down and Gravity. I've watched Pacific Rim and Gravity in 2D and looking forward to seeing them in 3D. These movies have pretty good bass tracks and I'm ready for that too.

I can deal with lighter black levels or uneven uniformity but a dull/lifeless/faded picture will get sent back every time.  I understand the limitations of \"LCD\" TVs.  Plasma sucks, IMO.  TVs, just like color, beauty, music, movies, and food are subjective.  What's good for you is not good for me and vice versa.  I'm glad you've found your perfect set.  I have one that's perfect but it's a 46\" and I need one that's 55\" for our living room.  Didn't one of you return your set for minor clouding/flashlighting?   You knew the limitations so why did you exchange it?  You were after that perfect set and it appears you got it. "

Hopefully some reviews come out soon.   The F8000 does have a true 240hz processor. Amazon can only advertise the true value in their title and it states 240hz for that TV. Seems like the only differences are a few little things like a new coating on the screen to improve contrast, a new software enhancement to improve depth of image, and a faster quad core processor for the smart TV system. IF those new image hardware / software elements do actually result in a improved image I guess I would go for the H8000 over the F8000 unless they give some crazy discount on the F8000 (as of right now they are way too close in pricing).. Personally looking for a 65inch and now that 65in 4k from Samsung and Sony are retailing for $4000 (and that will likely drop in a few months) wondering if its worth waiting and purchasing a more future proof 4K tv... I've been impressed with 4k content on larger screens, but seeing as how ill be sitting 10 ft away - wonder if ill note a difference. Big benefit I see is with 3D since it will be passive and 1080p to each eye (passive sets to my eyes are MUCH more comfortable for anything over 30 mins - I honestly don't think the active sets are good for vision, I'm in dental school not medical - but learned enough about eye anatomy to realize how eye strain can cause long term problems).. So its a conundrum.. "

I just think its a steep price for a 65in 1080p LCD in this day to be above the 3k price point (regardless of features). Like DRN94 noted, if the picture quality isn't greatly changed, i could care less for the smart hub either since I use my Apple TV and Oppo for everything.. So its all about picture quality, if the F goes on a decent sale id consider. The 2013 F9000 4k is actually $3500 right now - but I read some not so great reviews that turned me off to considering it, maybe the 2014 4ks will be improved. "

Yea so that was my concern - image quality (upscaling) since I have a decent blu-ray collection and motion handling.. Since it seems like 4k is going to be the new standard its just making me itch to get in on it, but you're right I think the current 4ks work at 30hz which causes a lot of motion blur, even at 60hz it won't look anything like the 240hz 1080p sets. It'll be a while before they fix that problem so I guess the most logical is F vs H8000 right now. Wait a few weeks to see how the H8000 reviews fare and how the F8000 prices change. "

		"description": "   I am shocked with the contrast ratio numbers on the H8000 in that review. The black level on the H8000 is almost twice that than on the F8000. Uniformity has also suffered, probably because of the difficulty of evenly distributing light across a curved screen. My F8000 has nearly perfect uniformity with no DSE whatsoever, the F8000 was praised for it's backlight uniformity. Now I'm even more glad I got the F8000. This is rather bizzare. Sony's W950B 1080p flagship for 2014 was supremely disappointing compared to the previous W900A flagship. And now Samsung's 1080p flagship is rather disappointing as well but not nearly as much as the Sony. Honestly, if you're into a 1080p set get the F8000. If you're interested in a 2014 set rather than the F8000, the flat 4K flagship may be the best option. That H8000 review also states that the 4K curved model has similar backlight uniformity issues. I foresaw these quality problems many many months ago as manufacturers were looking towards gimmicks to sell their TV's and not improve the picture quality. The W950B was a HUGE step backwards in terms of picture quality and the H8000 is a slight step backwards as well (lower contrast ratio, poor uniformity). Stay away from both of these TV's. "

This is a review for the UE H8000 which is European not UN. I'm not sure but I think some reviewers turn extras off, (local dimming), when testing, hence the poorer uniformity. There was no mention of local dimming so I can only assume they didn't activate it. I'm sure the F8000 doesn't have great uniformity either with local dimming off. "

I have the 55\" which was the size most reviewers looked at and it appeared to have the best uniformity out of all the other sizes. I didn't read the whole review but I didn't see any mention of the dimming. They have the UK version which may not have the dimming perhaps. I know the Canadian F8000 does not have local dimming so it is a possibility its missing from the UK version of the H8000. "

		"description": "   weird they make the US and UK versions with different software based enhancements? But I am sure that the Samsung website said local dimming for the H8000 and the 4k model above it (just checked). As far as the F8000.. the reviews I read stated pretty significant uniformity issues without engaging the local dimming (but excellent uniformity after that was engaged). For those that had no issues even with it turned off I guess it may have been luck of the draw. I know I was pretty unlucky with my first 60in 7100 and 2 Sony 850As. But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.

The \"H\" has more dimming zones and a better processor for smart hub. I did see the Sharp and it does look good but a lot of reviews from Amazon are so so. Mainly dead/stuck pixels. It is a Sharp Panel so I wouldn't be surprised to see purplish blacks, ghosting, and uniformity issues. "

High definition and blu-ray are nothing short of spectacular. I was watching football on Sunday and the hi def images were razor sharp and crystal clear. In close-up shots of the field you could almost count the blades of grass. I saw no motion blur at all especially when the camera pans during a long pass.  Regarding what Ken said about the \"fault finders\" once they find a fault then they can't unsee it. The best way to avoid that is to not look for it. Just sit back and enjoy what is surely the best(IMHO)1080p HDTV on the market today.  "

I have bought 4 televisions from them and every one arrived in perfect condition. They use UPS freight for shipping.  Depending on where you live, shipping takes 2 to 3 days. Visit their site and call them. You can place your order over the phone which is the way I ordered mine. They are a first class operation and will answer any questions you might have.

Of glasses so I was surprised to find 4.  Figured that since mine came with one remote, and 4 pair, that was a Canadian model thing.  Anyways, as mentioned early impressions are good and it seems like all thew H8000s come with a sammy panel so that's good.  Haven't done any messing around with the settings yet, haven't really had a chance. "

Yes all US sets will have the selectable Smart LED setting.  They actually added this setting in via a software update, I believe first production sets had it permanently enabled like non-USA sets.

It was from PC Richards which was a NY to CA delivery. I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don't know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don't have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it's also the most money I've ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don't even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray. "

Im still blown away with the clarity and sharpness of this TV. I did the firmware update to the latest before viewing any content. But I have to give big thanks to this OP for sharing his settings. The picture is amazingly more crisp and sharp from the factory settings. One thing I wanted to ask is there a way to make the picture quality less \"Soap Operaish\"? I remember I bought a LG led, and that was was the worst Soap Opera effect setting I have encountered but there was a setting which allowed it to take it off. Is there something for the Samsung as well? Thanks to everyone for sharing there experience with this tv set on this thread. "

Apparently Samsung keeps it on Auto, why I have no idea, not everyone loves the Hobbit Special effect look. So anyhow if anyone is wondering why there tv image is looking like a Soap Opera effect, there you go, turn of the auction motion plus or keep it on Clear. I found the Clear setting to be nice and smooth during fast motions.  Cheers! "

I know what GTA V is capable of looking like, as I've played it for many months on my Sony, and it looks dead on this thing.  Terrible aliasing as well.

Obviously I can turn game mode off &amp; turn on the Clear Motion feature (which actually works beautifully), but then the input lag makes the game totally unplayable.  I hate to say it, but my old Vizio M series had a better game mode than this TV and the Vizio was 1/3 the price.  Of course the Vizio's picture quality wasn't nearly as good for TV/movies though.  I've read through every post on this thread and am surprised nobody mentioned the noticable drop in PQ when switching to Game/PC mode.  Does anyone have any advice on how to get it looking decent?  I feel like for what I paid for this TV, it should meet my expectations--and at the moment, it does not.  If I want mediocre PQ while gaming, I'd just go back to the Vizio and save myself hundreds of dollars.  And one other disappointing discovery so far: The Hulu app won't output 5.1 on the UN48H8000.  It did on my Bravia.  I called Samsung &amp; they told me to call Hulu.  Called Hulu &amp; they claim they don't even transmit 5.1.  Huh??  Then how was I getting surround sound all that time with my Sony?  Are you guys able to get 5.1 with Hulu at all?  Grrrr, if only Sony had made that Bravia in 120hz it would have been so perfect! "

Cheers!       I hope you're right!  When you go to enable game mode though, it even says in the little description box \"There may be a slight degradation in graphic quality.\"  That's the understatement of the century.  I swear it makes my PS3 games look like PS2 games, and completely destroys the vibrant colors this TV is capable of producing in the other modes.  Everything looks flat, like on a cheap Vizio.  Why would they need to dumb down the colors in order to reduce input lag??  Anyway, Samsung is supposedly going to have someone contact me to try and find a solution.  If they can't, I've already made up my mind that I'm going to swap the H8000 for a Sony KDL50W800B instead (same TV as I had before, only bigger &amp; 120hz).  Sad because I know the KDL50W800B will be inferior to the Samsung in every other way, but the game mode on the H8000 is just not going to work for me unless there's some sort of workaround. "

I managed to walk out of there with the TV and 4 year warranty for the $1799 price. I was pretty stoked...until I got home. The ghosting on this TV was absolutely horrible! I returned the TV yesterday and was hesitant to bring home another fearing similar issues. Of course the Black Friday sale wasn't going on any longer but there are still a few TV's on sale. I noticed the UN55HU8000 on sale for $1899. Not a 4K but I really only went for the 4K based on the price. I managed to get the HU8000 at the exact deal I got on the HU7250 so I'm happy.  Now who has some killer settings!? "

I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don't know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don't have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it's also the most money I've ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don't even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.       Hi Neo,  As to the panel version, look on the end of the packing box. There should be an area that tells you the Model and serial number as well as the Version:, that may be a TS01 or TS02... Or you can find the label on the back of the set on the opposite side of the connector inputs.  I'm one of those folks who likes the curved screen. My engineer brain points out that when I look from the center out to the edges, from where I sit, the distance is almost the same. So what that means is the pixels are straight on, seems optimal to me. If I do the same with a flat screen, as I look to the edges I am looking at an ever increasing angle, i.e. the distance is further away as I look to the edges, just like moving off to the side from dead center. Just my view of the curved screen. I love my 55H8000.  The sound is much better also as I finally have my Denon 4520CI all hooked up. Just need to do a bit of clean up and run Audyssey. Even so, it sounds pretty nice  Also thinking of adding a second subwoofer, maybe SVS SB-2000 or SVS PC-2000... Although after watching U-571 last night I'm not sure I need anymore impact during the depth charge attack "

Since then, I have wall mounted in a room with no windows. Fortunately, the light in that room is behind the tv and the main light is protected from view by a ceiling drop.

I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don't know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don't have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it's also the most money I've ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don't even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.       For gaming you don't need to set an input name to PC on this particular TV.  To get the benefits of lower input lag on any input you just enable the \"Game Mode\" setting in your general settings menu.  This will allow you to be able to also have your Movie mode setup appropriately even if the input is from your game console, just make sure Game Mode is turned off and that your picture mode is set to Movie.  Then when you want to play a game just flip on Game Mode.  I noticed on my set that they way over - sharpen the image out of the box.  I believe movie mode was set to like 50 and standard was set to like 20 out of the box or vice versa. If your input sources are good you will NEVER need your sharpening set to anything past 5 in my experience.  I keep sharpening off completely for any modes coming out of my PS4 and 5 sharpening for my standard mode which I use for cable TV.  Looks fantastic!!  One last note.  For the absolute best image quality make sure you set your picture size to \"screen fit\" which will ensure that you get perfect 1:1 pixel mapping from your sources.

Corner light bleed and flashlighting is something that's killed me on my 55W900 and on the 65X900Bs ive been looking at. The Cinema Black feature does an amazing job at keeping blacks pitch black on letter bars even in a pitch black room. Im shocked, I figured only OLED could cure this issue (plasma aside).  The local dimming is pretty crazy here as well, credits, in a pitch black room with smart led enabled, I barely see any light blooming whatsoever around the lettering, unlike the Sonys, and black levels overall are phenomenal (tested Prometheus, scenes set in space, star fields looked phenomenal considering this is edge lit).  Also, something minor, but with speakers set to audio out, there is no popup whatsoever when using my Samsung smart remote to control my external speaker.  Other than that, motion is on point, couldnt be happier with it, gaming performance on gaming mode is excellent, no noticeable lag.  This TV has it all. "

My problem with the h8000 is all the colors seem faded.  No vibrancy at all.  Dynamic is unwatchable.  Standard is ok only if I bump the color from 50 to 70 but then everything is over saturated.  Natural is the best but it crushes blacks on video games.  Movie is not for me.  My 3 year old Samsung ccfl Lcd has an SQ01 Panel and the colors are spot on, vibrant,  and flesh tones are amazing.  The ES8000, which I had briefly, was a TS01 Panel and the picture was identical to my older Samsung.  Bad clouding was the reason I took it back.  Could see clearly during the day. "

AA Before you jump ship try another 55H8000 as you are clearly not happy with this one. All of the problems you are describing, I see absolutely none of them on my 55 inch. The only picture setting I don't like is dynamic. The other three settings are perfectly ok with me. I have been happy with mine since the day I got it and still haven't tweaked any settings except changing to the movie setting.  As far as your washed out colors, it may be your cable feed. Remember this saying? Garbage in, garbage out. Well it is definitely true and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  I think you should ask Amazon for an exchange and give the 55H8000 another chance. If you still aren't happy then you'll know that you didn't give up easily.  "

		"description": "   Ok, so I think I'm the first person on here to purchase one of the Asian model numbers of this set. Mine is: UA65H8000 with a TS01 panel. TV looks beautiful, but I'm having trouble with the HDMI inputs. I have 3 sources I want to connect to it:  1) Set Top Box 2) Windows 7 PC 3) PlayStation 4  Set Top seems to be required to go into HDMI input 1. No problem. Works great.  The Windows PC works fine plugged into HDMI input 4. But plugging it in to inputs 2 or 3 results in the screen resolution dropping to only 640x480. Windows displays it as a generic display with no option to set the resolution correctly. But through HDMI input 4 all is well and normal.  The PS4 was originally plugged into HDMI input 2. I've heard others use this successfully. But when I plug it it, the picture is fine, but there is no sound. The same happens when I plug it into input 3. I tried everything to fix it, swapping out cables, switching inputs, trying different audio settings on the PS4, turning things on and off. Apparently there is an issue with the 2.0 firmware update on the PS4 sometimes causing there to be an issue with the audio output over HDMI.  However, if I plug the PS4 into HDMI input 4, then the sound returns and everything works fine! Of course the problem now is that if I want to switch from the PC to the Playstation, I have to manually unplug and replug the HDMI cables. I had assumed that an HDMI input is basically and HDMI input and they they were relatively standard and interchangeable. There was no issue on my 5 year old LG TV this Samsung replaced.  So... any workarounds or suggestions for how I could get both the Playstation and Windows PC both plugged into the TV and functioning correctly? "

Thanks guys, please respond ASAP if possible.       I've had the UN65H8000 TV over a month and I really love it. I was exactly in the same boat before purchase. I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn't disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn't make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don't even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven't tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn't much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that's why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( &gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money. "

So far I'm finding the best picture is with the Natural mode, which I don't see many people suggesting. Just my opinion though. You can get standard to look pretty good, too. But there was an earlier post about the best settings in Movie mode from consumer reports or something and I thought it was bleh.  I just got a Yamaha YAS-93 sound bar. It's fantastic. The built in speakers were surprisingly good on the TV but this is just so much better. Got it at Costco for $190 ($230+ on Amazon).  Only question I have is that the TV only gives two options: PCM or DTS Neo 2:5. I have no idea which one to choose. Both seem to sound similar. I'm not audiophile so just wondering what you guys are using and what your thoughts are. "

		"description": "   I will try to remember tonight, if nobody else has answered.  At any rate, I have had this TV since shortly after it was released, in the form of the UN65H8000. The first panel I got had horrible light bleed in the lower left &amp; upper right corners. As many know, any light, including bleed, really rides the curve of the screen, creating faux-clouding. At any rate, I returned it &amp; the guy on the phone said he had a refused delivery that he could sell with full waranty as \"New; Opened Box\", for 50% off. Well, that was over a year ago &amp; that TDxx panel is darn near perfect. I really enjoy it &amp; while the curve doesn't do much for me  when it comes to movies &amp; TV, it is awesome while grinding away time on my PS4.  I think I will keep it in the media room for another year or two &amp; then look at the 75+ SUHD models. BTW, anyone considering picking one of these up, keep an eye out for deals from Paul's TV &amp; Appliance. They are an online retailer (big provider for Amazon) &amp; they also have brick &amp; mortar locations in Southern California. I have found them very helpful, honest &amp; reliable in my past dealings, going back over a decade.  Any way, as I was saying, this TV gives you a cool perspective when playing FPS games &amp; the brightness &amp; color are amazing. The video settings are pretty robust, so you can really dial in color, black, contrast &amp; brightness setting to your individual preference. I see a lot of people talk about certain calibration settings, but each panel will respond from slightly to extremely different to each setting. For me, I just start at the factory settings &amp; then use what changes were made in the calibration details in the forum, adjusting &amp; readjusting till they look good to my eyes, which is all that really matters in the end.

I am pretty sure i screwed up white balance settings since right now every value in sub menu is 128 and i am pretty sure it was different before. Even if panels are not comparable i still want to see maybe a possible tweaking window.  I love this tv, hooked up all consoles and pc and its amazing in game mode. Only complaint is that one of the recent firmware updates screwed up brightness setting for game mode but it was tweakable and not such a big pain. Please take some photos of service menu if you can. But remember if you even just enter service menu without changing anything it will reset all your picture settings from normal user interface. "

It turns off then automatically turns right back on. It does this multiple times everyday and is not a factor of being on too long, as it has happened only 5 minutes after turning on or it may happen after 1 hour. The process takes about 30 seconds and doesn't require any work on my part but the tv is only 1 month old. The local Samsung official service could not resolve this issue. I have tried suggestions from the different internet forums and topics, including some settings in my Wi-Fi router, but it doesn't help. Does anyone have the same issue or know how to resolve it? "

		"description": "     Hello. Per reviews I've read and recommendations on this forum I decided to buy the 55\" H8000 HDTV. I must say I'm quite pleased with it. THERE IS a difference between the H8000 and my former 32F6300 in terms of image quality. It's just a pleasure to watch it.  As one of the main purposes of my tv is to play video games (mostly PC games via my PC and some PS4 ones) and being accustomed to the great performance in that matter of my F6300 I must say the H8000 is quite as good as the F6300 but the F6300 still leads in terms of lag but the differente is nothing to talk about. In fact all reviews have given the H8000 a GREAT test result in gaming performance and I agree.  The PC mode works fantastically well. I am attaching two photos I took while playing Max Payne 3 with my PC all settings at full. The image and sense of immersion is really UNBELIEVABLES. Words cannot describe the feeling you just got to experience it first hand. The imperfections/pixelations shonw in the photos are because of my iPhone camera NOT the TV.  The only bad thing is that yesterday, just one week after buying it I discovered a RED STUCK PIXEL right in the middle of the screen that is quite noticiable although it's only one. Of course it's noticeable mostly only in dark/black screens but this tv it's a beauty showing black images so that's really a pity.  I read stuck pixels are more treatable than dead pixels. I tried the jscreenfix solution for about 20 minutes and although the intensity of the red stuck pixel diminished it went back again after some time. Then I tried this other site: www.flexcode.org and I noticed that just starting it the red stuck pixel light diminished more and then I left it also for about 20 minutes. The light have diminished but still there and last time I saw there was no light. It was very late at night so I couldn't keep trying but before turning off the TV I almost saw no light on the red stuck pixel. I don't know if the stuck pixel will come back but at least it diminished with said methods and that is saying something. Hopefully I can fix it. Though I'm a little OCD about it it's certainly disturbing to have said stuck pixel. "

Standard is ok only if I bump the color from 50 to 70 but then everything is over saturated.  Natural is the best but it crushes blacks on video games.  Movie is not for me.  My 3 year old Samsung ccfl Lcd has an SQ01 Panel and the colors are spot on, vibrant,  and flesh tones are amazing.  The ES8000, which I had briefly, was a TS01 Panel and the picture was identical to my older Samsung.  Bad clouding was the reason I took it back.  Could see clearly during the day.       AA Before you jump ship try another 55H8000 as you are clearly not happy with this one. All of the problems you are describing, I see absolutely none of them on my 55 inch. The only picture setting I don't like is dynamic. The other three settings are perfectly ok with me. I have been happy with mine since the day I got it and still haven't tweaked any settings except changing to the movie setting.  As far as your washed out colors, it may be your cable feed. Remember this saying? Garbage in, garbage out. Well it is definitely true and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  I think you should ask Amazon for an exchange and give the 55H8000 another chance. If you still aren't happy then you'll know that you didn't give up easily.        I'm still debating.  I really don't want to give up the black levels and uniformity but the picture is driving me nuts.  I have a rule of thumb, if i have to fiddle with settings for more than 5 minutes to get a good picture then there's something wrong with the TV.  I've had at least 10 high end and mid range tvs over the last 8 years, a few got returned, and the ones I kept took me 2-4 minutes to realize if it was good or not. "

You can't really rely on someone else telling you if you would see a difference or not. If you have the means to audition the 65\" in person, that will be the best way to answer your question. I can only guess, but I believe you would see a significant difference. "

I guess that's why they call it the panel lottery. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you don't. I hope whichever you decide on(7150 or 6400)works out for the best.  Good luck  "

I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn't disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn't make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don't even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven't tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn't much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that's why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( &gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money.       You had me fully convinced to get the H8000 but then you said the hu8550 at the very end lol. I tried the hu8550 already and it had ghosting issues and audio sync problems. I don't know if I just had a bad hu8550 or if this problem will persist. Everything else was really nice on the TV though. SO basically it is ust down to the hu8550 and the H8000. It also sucks to buy a TV right now because I know Samsung will be releasing new TVs in late March I was told. "

I'm trying to get the most out of the settings and, even if it's a fairly new tv, I haven't got much help from the internet in terms of calibrations. I'm using the tv as a pc monitor and learned it's a good idea to rename HDMI to PC, I did it, but find the image is kind of lacking in something I can't put my finger on. It looks blurrier than before?  I know all tv:s should be treated individually, but does anyone of you know the best settings for pc mode, game mode (both on pc and ps3) and movie mode for this particular model? I'm currently using pc mode for browsing the internet, but when it comes to watching videos or movies there must be a better way, should I always switch to movie mode when I open a video on youtube for example?  Bear with me, I'm really new with these kinds of tv:s. Any help would be appreciated! "

If so they will make the return process so easy you won't believe it.  The TV doesn't need to be unopened to return it if you are returning it due to a defect. They will send a new one and you can just put the bad TV in the box from the new one and have the delivery guys take it with them if you setup the exchange with Amazon Customer Service.

You're a GENIUS!!!! I followed your advised and based on said advise grab just a little more information and used a pencil (on the eraser side) and double covered it with a soft microfiber cloth I use to clean my glasses. I placed the pencil eraser (covered as I said) exactly on the stuck pixel very firmly and shut down my TV. Once the TV was shut down I pressed it even more firmly (something I have never done to any tv before) and turned on the TV and the pixel was still there but barely there. So, I repeated the procedure once again \"pressing\" the pixel even harder than before, kept it that away for about 10 seconds and then turned on again the tv. Then, like playing a tablet game there was still a very little part of the pixel (it was now moving like if it was alive!) and without turning off the tv or pressing hard, just touched said pixel and then it was gone!!!  I've been using the TV playing movies and stuff (I haven't turn it down yet because I'm working with my PC on the same room) and the stuck pixel is not there. The all black, all blue screens where the pixel was most noticeable shows no stuck pixel. Just a few minutes ago I played the same movie in the same scene that was when I discovered the stuck pixel and it's not there. In other words: the stuck pixel is gone!!!! I just couldn't believe you just could literally \"erase\" a stuck pixel!!!!!  Your post was so assuring and helpful!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! "

Has anyone ever bought what essentially sounds like an open box item from a 3rd party seller on Amazon?       Number one: I would never buy anything from a third party seller. Number two: If it sounds to good to be true, it probably isn't. Number three: Do yourself a huge favor(if you can afford to)and only buy if it ships directly from Amazon. Number four: If you have the opportunity, audition one in person at a big box store like Best Buy, Abt, PCRichard, HHGregg etc.  And finally, I would never buy an open box, no matter how attractive the price  Of course, you are entitled to do what you wish, but I'm hoping you will take my four points into consideration.  One more thing. I can strongly recommend Crutchfield. They are an authorized retailer. They offer a 60 day money back guarantee, free shipping and free lifetime tech support. I have bought numerous products from them and their customer service is excellent.   "

		"description": "   Firmly decided to buy the H8000. I want a well rounded TV with a quality image for low lag gaming, movies, and 3D. This TV seems to be the best overall option. Need to decide if I should buy the 55\" at 2 grand or the 65\" at 2.7 grand for that enhanced home theater experience. I have to buy at PC Richards as I have some credit there. As it is for my bedroom I would be fine with either size, but I don't want to have that need to upgrade feeling later on. However the 65\" one is slightly pricey for me and I might just settle for a 55\" with an XBOX One. I already have the PS4 but I am a fan of the respective systems exclusives like Halo and The Last of Us. Buying the 65\" would put off the XBOX One purchase til Next year for sure, and I will be late to the party with Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Tough choice for me. "

A great collection for someone like me who likes Halo, dabbled in it, but never played half of them or played them to death. And I am looking forward to watching Blu-Rays in style like Captain America 2 in 3D, playing The Last of Us Remastered on a quality display bigger than 23 inches is going to be awesome. "

More than awesome, it would be life-changing!  Seriously, I still remember the first time I played at 32\" when I was used to play with a 27\" monitor. The monitor was a 1440p, mind you, versus a 1080p 32\" but seeing the great immersion it provided + some heavy AA and I totally forgot the 27\" monitor for good. Now I am readY to do the change from my beloved 32\" HDTV to a set just like yours, the 55\" H8000! "

Have you considered LG's 55\" OLED? 55EC9300 ?: Official OWNERS thread for 2014 OLED LG 55ec9300 Part II  Although they do have some panel issues also... Ooops, reading the preview I'm reminded this OLED is curved also. New flat panel may be coming soon... "

Both looked great to me.  Looking at 2D immediately afterwards sure looks \"flat\"  Next 3D features in my lineup; Pacific Rim, Upside Down and Gravity. I've watched Pacific Rim and Gravity in 2D and looking forward to seeing them in 3D. These movies have pretty good bass tracks and I'm ready for that too. Popcorn, a Coke and nobody kickin' the back of my chair  Glad that I have a decent panel... Hope AA finds one that is \"good enough\". "

I can deal with lighter black levels or uneven uniformity but a dull/lifeless/faded picture will get sent back every time.  I understand the limitations of \"LCD\" TVs.  Plasma sucks, IMO.  TVs, just like color, beauty, music, movies, and food are subjective.  What's good for you is not good for me and vice versa.  I'm glad you've found your perfect set.  I have one that's perfect but it's a 46\" and I need one that's 55\" for our living room.  Didn't one of you return your set for minor clouding/flashlighting?   You knew the limitations so why did you exchange it?  You were after that perfect set and it appears you got it. "

My Directv channels vary quite a bit - HBO, Showtime, BBCA look consistently great, while other shows - especially dark looking ones, like 'Sleepy Hollow' can have significant blocky artifacts in dark areas. And some shows look sharp and in focus, while others look soft. But Blu-Rays look fine, so I believe it is not the set, but the quality of the broadcast from Directv, which of course is compressed quite a bit.  Have you tried calibrating your set? I have been able to both improve the Directv picture and hide many of the artifacts by changing the settings on mine. "

Maybe I was expecting more   Release prices are generally more than I'm willing to pay so if I come across a good price I'll pick up something I want.  Post your impressions. I'm certainly not sorry to have these titles in my small collection. I know I'll eventually watch them all again.  WOW, I hope you can win the contest!  PS: I don't know about Amazon UK. "

The tv looks great, the colors are very nice and the tests I've seen in a few different shops was great.  But when I watch a movie via my computer(connecting like a second screen) I am not happy with the results at all. Its a bit choppy, nothing like the tests at the shop. It feels like the hz is very low and I get frustrated and instead just watches the movie on my computer screen.  I also tried copying the movie over on an usb and tried connecting to the tv, same issue, not impressed.  Is there any settings I can change? After 2 years back and forth with phillips I'm so feckin angry I could explode. Why won't my tv just work? "

I compare it to my brothers 50 inch LG and i feel like he gets a consistently better clearer picture on Cable channels.. he has Verizon Fios Cable while i have directv.. Im tempted to exchange this set for a 70LB7100 LG.. but i see a lot of mixed reviews for it I tried playing some movies from my laptop connected to the tv via HDMI cable.. and it did look like crap I transferred some of the movies over to an external drive, and connected it directly to the tv using USB.. and they played significantly better.. Dont really understand that either... If i change a channel, i feel like i have to adjust the settings every time.. "

But I wasn't exactly looking after it either because I asumed everything would be allright. I'll certainly look closer next time.  It's not like its a HUGE problem, something you notice straight away or is very easily noticable. But there is always this feeling something is not right and when I look closer its good or pretty. So its making very uncertain if its a fault with the tv or just me having too high expectations.  On the other hand my old phillips felt smoother than this one, so that really should says something.

A great collection for someone like me who likes Halo, dabbled in it, but never played half of them or played them to death. And I am looking forward to watching Blu-Rays in style like Captain America 2 in 3D, playing The Last of Us Remastered on a quality display bigger than 23 inches is going to be awesome.       Hi Neo,  I gave up watching TV about 14 years ago. Several years ago I decided to get a bluray player and watch movies on my 27\" 1080 computer monitor. Finally decided to go bigger and ended up getting the 55H8000. The viewing experience is completely different :-) If the H8000 has any flaws I don't notice them, I just enjoy the great, to me, picture  I'm not a gamer so I have no idea as to that side of things. Only thing connected to the set is my BP through a Denon AVR.  Stepping up from 23\" is huge! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do, and I believe many other owners of the set do also. "

Everything else is at it's default setting other than Cinema Black (high), Dynamic Contrast (low), and Smart LED (high).  Picture Setting is on Standard. "

		"description": "   Hey Imoen if you are still around... I set up an exchange with Best Buy and then quickly canceled it after I saw these comments from another thread in here for a similar tv and then played around with them  My general settings where I get no flash lighting are Standard, brightness 34, backlight 3-7 (night time, nice and dark) but change it to 10-15 (daytime when blinds are open. I will notice flash lighting when I go 7+ on backlight or higher than 34 on the brightness), Contrast 90, Eco mode off, Dynamic Contrast LOW (This I feel pops the picture slightly without losing detail in the color gradients any higher I notice the grey bar deviate too much from the true picture), and Dark for the black level ( this I feel makes sure the image source is always getting black in the picture to improve the contrast, any higher and you get black crush), sharpness is set to 40, color 50, Tint I think off the top of my head was 44/56 or somewhere around there. I noticed the set had some slight green hue, so I had to trim that and add some red. I used the TV's blue color filter with some CD calibration tool I downloaded here. For the picture I use Cool (sports) or Warm 1 (movies/TV). I have LED motion off, Cinema Off, Motion rate is set to Clear, HDMI level is LOW. I found that the HDMI level low gives me the best deep blacks especially at night. But I counter it with gamma +3 to bring out any dark shadows in the picture. Reason why is that When I look at cable content I notice that since the Cable HD source quality is lower than that of blue ray or video games the deeper grey/blacks sometimes get lost. The increase in gamma brings it out. However if that is not enough for the content I'm viewing I bring it back to Normal, But that's pretty rare...the content has to be a very low quality such as a poor video stream. The mpg stuff I leave on auto I like it since it makes the picture look better on downloaded movies I view with lower quality on such a big set. Blue Ray or Video game content looks phenomenal and feel like it has a nice color range with HDMI Black Low. I think that's it for my settings.  What has made an impact for me with this tv is  standard mode- backlight 16-18 (i change this based on what im watching) brightness 43-47 (same as above) dynamic contrast - high gamma- +3 digital clean view - high or auto MPEG noise filter- high or auto sharpness 30-40 Auto Motion Plus - clear Smart Led- Low  Once i switched to these, i got caught watching 300 Rise of An Empire on cinemax.. and stayed up way late.. and couldnt stop watching..  This is for Directv viewing only.. when i switch to another input or source youd have to change these again.. Is there a way to save settings for USB input and different hdmi inputs without changing these every time? I realize these settings go against all the others that have been posted here, but this seems to be a very subjective thing from person to person im seeing I dont see how anyone could use Movie mode.. it is so dull, lifeless, and dark..

First off, let me say that this will be my last post on this God forsaken forum period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  truerogue With all of the futzing and tinkering you do I wonder if you will ever really be satisfied(I don't think so). Then you sit there and say \"I can see flashlighting with these settings but not with the other settings. The only reason you see flashlighting is because you are sitting there looking for it. You seem to be searching for the perfect picture. If there was a perfect TV, AVS Forum wouldn't exist because there would be nothing to complain about. Perhaps you should return the TV and listen to the radio, but you would probably find something to complain about whilst doing that.  As I've said before, I believe the Samsung H8000 series HDTV is one of the finest TV's on the market today. I sure am enjoying mine.   GOODBYE  AVS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    "

Picture quality rated by most as better than anything out there. We are still using a 50\" 8 year old Panasonic plasma but it still looks good and only has 15,000 hours on it. Really hesitant to buy now but we're not so sure the Panny will make it until prices start falling on our preferred OLED TVs. A couple of grand for retired fixed incomes is a hard decision but we do love the big screens/great picture. "

It's a TS01 Panel so I guess that's Samsung?  I'm confused about the setting for the PlayStation 4, WiiU and AppleTV though. should I just rename the source to PC or rename it to Game or set the Game Mode on via Settings &gt; General?  I got my First Impressions up on my own blog (not sure if I post it here) if anyone's keen, I can share (: "

I think the blacks are pretty good and there my be a bit of black crush at times but such events pass by and I really don't know how much if any details were lost. Honest officer, it was too dark to see anything.  I did, early on, reduce the backlight level to 10, IIRC, based on comments here...  I recall, either here, or one of the other threads I've been reading that for the fault finders once they search and find something then they can't \"unsee\" it (to paraphrase whatever they actually wrote). So I sit back and relax, watch, and enjoy the movie.  I hope some of the more expert folks can give you a better answer. "

Today I accidentally turned off my TV from the remote control and then immediately turn it on (after 4 to 5 sec). There was no picture on the screen, but sound was coming out from the speakers. I could switch the channel, but again no picture nothing on the screen. Then I turned it off again, waited for 1 minutes and turned on. The picture was back. Updated firmware to the latest version, but it didn't fix the issue.  It looks like software problem, but I didn't find any claims about the same issue on forums. Or maybe better to replace it? "

Only thing I've noticed is that voice can be really faint, I sometimes have to crank the volume to 50 even though there's no sound in the apt and the TV is like 10 feet away. The clear voice sound option helps but then everything sounds washed out. Hoping the Soundbar will help with that by providing more balance across the range. "

		"description": "   Hi there. So as I \"suffer\" a \"little\" OCD and couldn't find the correct  fit-all height for my TV and tried and tried a lot of possible  configurations and furniture I decided the way to go was to have the TV  attached to a TV mount. One TV mount with height adjust, tilt adjust so I  could move up or down, forward or back and tilt my TV as I needed. This  because when I play video games with my TV I seat near and when  watching movies I sit far and when watching music videos not to far not  to back...anyway.  There isn't a lot of options but I bought the  best one being that I could easily say this is the best commercial  available TV mount on the market: The Omni Mount Play 70.  I  installed with some professional help and words nor picture do justice  for how beautiful the TV looks. It looks like it is suspended in the  air. I can recommend this TV mount 100%.  I have attached some pictures. Please excuse the low quality of the iPhone pictures. "

As for how the H8000  compares to the M70, the H8000 will trounce the Vizio in color  reproduction and picture video processing but it can be argued that the  M70 has a more effective dimming scheme and it's a much better value.  I'm hopeful Vizio with their FALD televisions will shame Samsung towards  offering such televisions at affordable prices next year because  frankly I think Samsung can do them a lot better.

The Cinema Black feature does an amazing job at keeping blacks pitch black on letter bars even in a pitch black room. Im shocked, I figured only OLED could cure this issue (plasma aside).  The local dimming is pretty crazy here as well, credits, in a pitch black room with smart led enabled, I barely see any light blooming whatsoever around the lettering, unlike the Sonys, and black levels overall are phenomenal (tested Prometheus, scenes set in space, star fields looked phenomenal considering this is edge lit).  Also, something minor, but with speakers set to audio out, there is no popup whatsoever when using my Samsung smart remote to control my external speaker.  Other than that, motion is on point, couldnt be happier with it, gaming performance on gaming mode is excellent, no noticeable lag.  This TV has it all.       I'm curious, have you watched any 4:3 content with side bars and if so how uniform do they look (I'll be happy to hear from anyone on this)?  I don't see how Cinema Black would have any effect on side bars.  The M series has no uniformity issues whatsoever and both the top and bottom bars look great but its poor video processing is a deal killer for me.  It sounds like blooming is less noticeable on the H8000 but probably at the cost of effective contrast.  The F8500 suits my needs the best but it's base design will not work in my bedroom. "

They also have free shipping and a 60 money  back guarantee. You also get lifetime technical support at no extra cost. I have bought 4 televisions from them and every one arrived in perfect condition. They use UPS freight for shipping.  Depending on where you live, shipping takes 2 to 3 days. Visit their site and call them. You can place your order over the phone which is the way I ordered mine. They are a first class operation and will answer any questions you might have. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.  "

		"description": "   Ok the auto switching my receiver to TV input is really starting to piss me off.  I switched off of the ARC HDMI input and hooked up the TV to the receiver with an optical cable thinking it was ARC triggering my receiver to switch inputs.   Even after doing this is STILL switches inputs when I turn the TV on.  The only way to get it to stop is to disable Anynet+ completely but that obviously kills all of the convenience of it as well.   Also when disabled there's no TV Speaker \"off\" option that I can find?  I just have to turn the volume all the way down?   Stupid.......  Anyone have any better luck with this than me?  On a weird side note when Anynet+ is on my receiver shows the input signal is Dolby Digital but when it's off its PCM?  I have my Xfinity box set to \"surround\"?  How is that even possible when the audio source is the same and not from the TV?!?!   I'm so confused!  Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk "

		"description": "   I've read this post from page 1 to the last one and I don't seem to recall much love for a HDTV! I watch movies with my projector but I use my HDTV (32\" Samsung 32F6300) on a daily basis to play video games (both with my PC and my PS4) and to watch movies when I don't want to use my home theater. Since I actually enjoy both activities (video games &amp; movie watching) I've been thinking about the possibility to upgrade my TV and went looking for the LG 55\" 4K OLED TV. The cons I read were enough to put me away for paying that much for a non \"perfect\" TV for my uses and then I read about the 55\" UN55H8000 HDTV.  I have some quick questions for the owners of this HDTV that I would be very grateful if you gave me your insight:  1. I've seen that many people here play video games with the 55H8000 and they talk about the immersive feeling the curved display gives. If I don't notice any lag whatsoever with my 32\" Samsung 32F6300 when playing video games to the point that I don't even use the GAME MODE, should I be fine with the 55H8000? (I play mostly games like GTA 5, Watch Dogs, COD and driving games like Grid 2). I plan to use the 55H8000 on the same room I have the 32\" and seat reasonably closer like 5.4 - 6 foot to play video games.  2. Being that my TV is said 32\" Samsung 32F6300 (that's the 6000 series) would I get a best picture quality with the 55H8000 when watching movies? By better I mean better colors rendition, better blacks and contrast and overall and improvement so I could notice the difference from my former TV?  3. For \"just\" about $300 more I could get the 55\" 4K Samsung HU8700 TV or even pay less for the 4K HU7250 TV. I know 4K it's supposed to be \"better\" BUT if ALL my content will be at 1080p because I don't forth see a lot of 4K content in both video games and movies in the next 2-3 years, if I were to play said 1080p content on any of those 4K TV would I get the same or better image of the H8000 TV? Is it true the 4K TVs produces more input lag than a 1080p? I read some place that a 4K TV actually UPSCALES the 1080p content to an almost 4K content so if that it's true the 4K TV would be a no brainer...  4. Last question: Amazon.com is selling the UN55H8000 at US$1997,99. Do you think this price could go lower at Black Friday? Being that this HDTV seems to be a very popular model I wouldn't like to wait until Black Friday to see if the price can go lower and then realize that not only did the price didn't went low but that the TV went into unavailability.  Thank you a lot for your help! Much appreciated!      "

Is the Audio Out 5.1? My current Samsung only outputs audio in stereo. Also, can you use the split screen with two HDMI sources (or is it only for the built in apps)?  Thanks "

I know 4K it's supposed to be \"better\" BUT if ALL my content will be at 1080p because I don't forth see a lot of 4K content in both video games and movies in the next 2-3 years, if I were to play said 1080p content on any of those 4K TV would I get the same or better image of the H8000 TV? Is it true the 4K TVs produces more input lag than a 1080p? I read some place that a 4K TV actually UPSCALES the 1080p content to an almost 4K content so if that it's true the 4K TV would be a no brainer...  4. Last question: Amazon.com is selling the UN55H8000 at US$1997,99. Do you think this price could go lower at Black Friday? Being that this HDTV seems to be a very popular model I wouldn't like to wait until Black Friday to see if the price can go lower and then realize that not only did the price didn't went low but that the TV went into unavailability.  Thank you a lot for your help! Much appreciated!        Do yourself a big favor and buy the H8000 Samsung. You definitely will not regret it.  Also I think 4k tv is still a few years away from being a worthwhile purchase. "

		"description": "   Ok, I am almost reading to buy the UN55H8000 HDTV and I am way to excited! Just to quick questions: I read a review saying that even though the 55H8000 is a great TV, you could get the same results with the lower price Samsung H7150 even though I have make a specs comparison between those 2 models and the H8000 was Micro Dimming Ultimate and the H7150 has Micro Dimming Pro and the H8000 has CMR of 1200 and the H7150 of 960 and I like the curved model because I will use these TV (the H8000) only for myself for playing video games and watching some movies that my family don't like so I can be seated near and at the perfect center. So does buying the H8000 over the H7150 makes sense?  The second and last question is in comparison with the 55\" HU8700 &amp; HU8550 because I read a review saying that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal those 4K TVs is quite good and you can see every detail but on the other hand I have read other reviews and post saying that the upscaling a 4K TV does degrades or makes blurry the 1080p image and introduceds lag. The H8000 has the better ms response rate in gaming and said 4K models are worst but if it could be true that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal actually creates a better looking image the H8000 would provide it could make some sense to buy the 4K model.  What do you think? Thank you!!! "

I remember just last year the thought of buying the top of the line Samsung Series (8000 Series) was just of a thought because of the high price and now we can buy at a reasonable price what seems to be one of the best 1080 HDTV ever.  Will post pictures! "

		"description": "   so here goes my experience:  purchased the 65\" coming up on 4 weeks ago from visions electronics here in surrrey, canada. ts01 panel type, sep 2014 manf date.  upon turning it on, the right side of the panel was perfect. the left side of the panel had minor clouding. however, approx 15 inches from the left was massive clouding all the way from top to bottom. picture a flashlight shining from the bottom up. telling you any dark scene was not watchable would be an understatement.  i got on the phone with samsung canada, who immediately booked a local area service company to contact me. the company called me and indicated they would order a \"new panel\" and that it would take 1-2 weeks to arrive.  the tech showed up today with a tv in a normal looking box, not new from what you get from the store. he did the normal speech that clouding is normal on all led tvs...now while i thought im getting a new tv, he took what he brought and opened all the screws and TOOK the panel out of it and proceeded to exchange it with mine. i stayed quiet thinking i would blow up at the end. but to my surprise, the new panel is 100x better. there is clouding on the edges but nothing that is overly distracting.  ill see how it goes over the next few days and report back if anything goes wrong....

I don't necessarily like the curve but it's very subtle and the alternative doesn't compete with the PQ.       Several decades ago I started wearing progressive lenses in my glasses and I know some folks couldn't get comfortable with them... what I noticed was that they introduced a curve, similar to what I see on my H8000. Fortunately the progressive lenses didn't bother me and I'm fine with the curve on my Samsung but maybe some folks just won't feel comfortable with the curve. No right or wrong or which is best except for each individual, IMO. It does have processing that increases contrast(?) on objects determined to be closer to the viewer adding a sense of depth and this kinda pulls me into the picture. YVMV  I was looking at the 55H7150 at first and after seeing the 55H8000 I kept coming back to it so I finally decided to go with it, fortunately I'm quite happy with my choice. If its easy to return then that makes taking a chance a bit easier... I suspect either one would have been okay because I wouldn't be comparing them continually  I mostly just enjoy the picture and as someone else posted, don't recall if it was on this thread, once they found a problem they couldn't not see it. So if its not readily noticable I'll enjoy the picture. I did lower the backlight to around 10 which seemed better for me.  And while I have the 55H8000 I noticed with my latest prescription the magnification factor is such that I see an image roughly a foot wider... so I get a ~ a 65+\" view for the price of the 55\" model "

Since my 55H8000 looks like a 65+\" set to me, I can understand wanting a larger screen, it does make a difference IMO. I enjoyed watching my brothers 47\" Samsung during visits but I knew if I bought one I wanted at least a 55\". I sit about 8' from the screen and wouldn't want it any smaller.  As with the review you mention from England, it seems most of us on the thread are happy with the 55H8000.  I doubt I qualify as an audiophile or videophile  As noted before I am enjoying the picture and the sound, especially with the added subwoofer but I am looking forward to getting the 4520CI powered up as the surround element is missing. Hope to start on running speaker wires in the next couple of days.  All the best, "

At $1884, it's still over $700 cheaper than most other places. My viewing distance is 8' so initially I wanted a 55\" but the 65\" is actually cheaper right now. I'm worried about the picture quality at 8' away. Does anyone else sit relatively close to their 65\"?  BTW, it looks like Best Buys are getting rid of their display models so you might be able to pick up an open box one. I saw one for $2398. "

A question? If you weren't satisfied why didn't you just contact the place of purchase and request an exchange. If it were me, I would have demanded an exchange and not even messed around with a panel change. "

I've  been very disappointed  with the performance  of this tv with those two apps. YouTube and web browser are among  the TV's best features.  If you use the mutli view thing you would except it to work good. I had an f8000 and i never experienced  this problem before and this tv is sopose to be 2 times faster and better with the quad core plus. I know in the beginning  i had problems with the screensaver and that was fix with a firmware update. I had the motherboard  replaced twice now so I'm  wondering if its a universal  problem. "

		"description": "   Okay, just got my new UN65H800! Quite happy with it so far, but noticeable black uniformity issues unless Smart LED is turned on.  I run my blu ray player and my PC through my Denon receiver, through HDMI to the TV. When I name this source \"PC\" then switch sources on the receiver from actual PC to blu ray, the TV somehow knows these inputs are different and will save different picture settings for each. This is nice, and would be perfect if PC mode allowed Smart LED to be activated. I use my PC for games, and the flashlighting turns up more in games than it does in movies it seems (loading screens, etc.).  Otherwise, if I name that source on the TV \"game\" or \"AV Receiver\", whatever picture settings I set are global for that TV source, regardless if I change the Denon's source. This is annoying since I'd want to use something like game mode, and different sharpness settings for when the Denon's source is my PC vs movie settings for when the Denon's source is my blu ray.  Any ideas? "

Hopefully some reviews come out soon.   The F8000 does have a true 240hz processor. Amazon can only advertise the true value in their title and it states 240hz for that TV. Seems like the only differences are a few little things like a new coating on the screen to improve contrast, a new software enhancement to improve depth of image, and a faster quad core processor for the smart TV system. IF those new image hardware / software elements do actually result in a improved image I guess I would go for the H8000 over the F8000 unless they give some crazy discount on the F8000 (as of right now they are way too close in pricing).. Personally looking for a 65inch and now that 65in 4k from Samsung and Sony are retailing for $4000 (and that will likely drop in a few months) wondering if its worth waiting and purchasing a more future proof 4K tv... I've been impressed with 4k content on larger screens, but seeing as how ill be sitting 10 ft away - wonder if ill note a difference. Big benefit I see is with 3D since it will be passive and 1080p to each eye (passive sets to my eyes are MUCH more comfortable for anything over 30 mins - I honestly don't think the active sets are good for vision, I'm in dental school not medical - but learned enough about eye anatomy to realize how eye strain can cause long term problems).. So its a conundrum.. "

I just figured they're trying to compete with Sonys Triluminous but if the F8000 had it I'm sure the H8000 is prob the same. I just think its a steep price for a 65in 1080p LCD in this day to be above the 3k price point (regardless of features). Like DRN94 noted, if the picture quality isn't greatly changed, i could care less for the smart hub either since I use my Apple TV and Oppo for everything.. So its all about picture quality, if the F goes on a decent sale id consider. The 2013 F9000 4k is actually $3500 right now - but I read some not so great reviews that turned me off to considering it, maybe the 2014 4ks will be improved. "

Yea so that was my concern - image quality (upscaling) since I have a decent blu-ray collection and motion handling.. Since it seems like 4k is going to be the new standard its just making me itch to get in on it, but you're right I think the current 4ks work at 30hz which causes a lot of motion blur, even at 60hz it won't look anything like the 240hz 1080p sets. It'll be a while before they fix that problem so I guess the most logical is F vs H8000 right now. Wait a few weeks to see how the H8000 reviews fare and how the F8000 prices change. "

		"description": "   I am shocked with the contrast ratio numbers on the H8000 in that review. The black level on the H8000 is almost twice that than on the F8000. Uniformity has also suffered, probably because of the difficulty of evenly distributing light across a curved screen. My F8000 has nearly perfect uniformity with no DSE whatsoever, the F8000 was praised for it's backlight uniformity. Now I'm even more glad I got the F8000. This is rather bizzare. Sony's W950B 1080p flagship for 2014 was supremely disappointing compared to the previous W900A flagship. And now Samsung's 1080p flagship is rather disappointing as well but not nearly as much as the Sony. Honestly, if you're into a 1080p set get the F8000. If you're interested in a 2014 set rather than the F8000, the flat 4K flagship may be the best option. That H8000 review also states that the 4K curved model has similar backlight uniformity issues. I foresaw these quality problems many many months ago as manufacturers were looking towards gimmicks to sell their TV's and not improve the picture quality. The W950B was a HUGE step backwards in terms of picture quality and the H8000 is a slight step backwards as well (lower contrast ratio, poor uniformity). Stay away from both of these TV's. "

This is a review for the UE H8000 which is European not UN. I'm not sure but I think some reviewers turn extras off, (local dimming), when testing, hence the poorer uniformity. There was no mention of local dimming so I can only assume they didn't activate it. I'm sure the F8000 doesn't have great uniformity either with local dimming off. "

I have the 55\" which was the size most reviewers looked at and it appeared to have the best uniformity out of all the other sizes. I didn't read the whole review but I didn't see any mention of the dimming. They have the UK version which may not have the dimming perhaps. I know the Canadian F8000 does not have local dimming so it is a possibility its missing from the UK version of the H8000. "

		"description": "   weird they make the US and UK versions with different software based enhancements? But I am sure that the Samsung website said local dimming for the H8000 and the 4k model above it (just checked). As far as the F8000.. the reviews I read stated pretty significant uniformity issues without engaging the local dimming (but excellent uniformity after that was engaged). For those that had no issues even with it turned off I guess it may have been luck of the draw. I know I was pretty unlucky with my first 60in 7100 and 2 Sony 850As. But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.

Might be a little different with the 240Hz Panel on the h8000 but the 7150 also has a 240Hz panel and a lot of people have complained about jerkiness to the picture on anything but clear. "

		"description": "     My son plays with a PS3 and a PS4;  he says that there is a noticeable difference when using game mode. Maybe as much as a 1/2 second difference.  Just his thoughts, not measured at all. The PS4 must be turned on to be recognized before game mode can be selected. The PS4 is in HDMI 2.  We received the 48 inch version of the TV yesterday. So too early for a considered evaluation.  But, initial thoughts are very positive. I have scoured this forum for a couple of weeks. I had never heard of all the things that can go wrong with an LED screen. Clouding, flashlighting,  light bleed, banding, oh my!!!!  From what I have seen so far and after looking for it with a black screen at night and dark scenes at night, I have panel TS01 and I have not seen any such issues yet.  I went from my CRT Sony Trinitron Wega 1080i 36 inch. I loved that tv. But, after 8 years it died.  I planned to get a Sony as I have only had a Sony for over thirty years. My husband is still watching and enjoying a 2003 Sony XBR LCD!  But, after much research reading reviews and this forum, I decided on this Samsung H8000.    It made the list of 10 best televisions in the world as did a couple of Sony televisions.  Right out of the box, the picture is crisp, no motion issues,  colors are great, skin tones look natural, and the black levels are very dark with no light bleed at all. Right out of the box in standard picture mode, it is almost perfect for me. We tweaked the settings very slightly in standard mode.  I put sound on clear voice mode.  The only trouble I am having at all is voice recognition when trying to use voice interaction.  I was actually sad to not get a Sony, seriously almost 1/2 my life with a Sony tv!!!  But, this tv is amazing to me and is far superior in picture quality to my 2006 CRT. And, to the 2003 Sony XBR, granted that Sony is an older tv. "

		"description": "   I got mine about 7 days ago.  Its the US version.  Its a TD02.   I like the TV, but then I also don't like it.  I was VERY leary about getting a SAMSUNG..I have Panasonic Plasma (that I love) &amp; an older Mitshubishi LCD.  I LOVE the 3D on this.  I LOVE the SMARTness and the apps.   I think the picture is good, but Damn it needs a real tune (mine is in the basement and its darker down there...LOL).  I do have setting that I can live with.   I have tried many tunes.  I have tried some in this thread.  I think its best to use the \"auto\" setting for the 10-point.  Bottom line for me is that my AVR equipment is not playing friendly with it (that bugs the living crap out of me).   Samsung must HATE Pioneer or vice-versa.  To me it's a travesty that this TV wants to force the use of an optical connection to my SC-72 (SC-72 is a 2013 receiver and an awesome one at that).  I have switched the receiver to allow ARC...I have played with the DVI HDMI input and other video conversion settings on my receiver and this TV just will not support true HDMI discovery/ARC with my Pioneer.  I will NOT use an Optical cable to make it happy.  Instead I have to move the input manually to get them all to \"play nice in the sand box\".   My Panasonic sure had no issues with Pioneer!!!   I am on the fence about taking this back...I like the TV.  My Pioneer BDP-62FD Blu-Ray gets detected by the TV and will auto switch to the proper input, but its slow and you see the stupid on-screen msg about the source not present (that's crap and SLOW!).  Also when watching a BD the 16:9 black bars sometimes go in and out between \"full screen\" while playing the same movie.  I want \"full\" not black bars.  Cant seem to get that sorted even with the SmartBD option turned off.   Basically, I will be calling Pioneer, but I think it's the TV.  If I have to hook up an optical just to get the units to talk outside of pure HDMI then I say \"F\" this TV!!!  I surely value my Pioneer elite AVR better than the TV!   I have all HDMI 2.0 high end cables.   BTW: If you want to reset this TV back to \"out of box settings\" then you need the PIN number.  I called Samsung last night.  the PIN is 0000 (4 zeros).   If I can get the thing to like Pioneer then I am keeping it...it is a nice picture when It wants to be.  I still want real tune settings for a dark room however,   Sorry for the long read, but please someone \"help\" me with the Pioneer stuff and I will love this TV.   I also have a PS4 and it works with Game mode on or off, but Game mode seems better. "

If I try to use true ARC and hook Verizon, PS4, and BD to TV, then take TV to SC-72 I would only get Dolby 5.1 from Apps and get 2.0 from PCM(also would require optical as well) instead of full 7.1 HD sound with one HDMI.  I realize I can switch receiver to an input and get both via an HDMI, but TV wont allow it automatically without conversion that will create input-lag that will make video and audio suffer for different things(IE: video lag to great for games &amp; Audio would not be HD to allow for proper streamed video).  I also still have no idea how to make the Input on this H8000 be PC???  Does anyone know if I can use the Receiver's 2 separate HDMI \"outputs\" go to TV instead of TV to AVR \"Inputs\"?  That way I would have audio and video HDMI split?  I am not a pro here by any means. "

Hope to start on running speaker wires in the next couple of days.  All the best,       Hi Ken The biggest tv I've ever had is 46\". I bought a 55\" Sony x850b but it was returned due to panel problems. The day I returned it I set up the 46\" and immediately noticed the difference between 46\" and 55\". The 55\" was much easier on my 68 year old eyes.  I'm going to get the un55h8000 and the 46\" Sony will be relegated to bedroom duties.  BTW, I too am retired. "

While I like the added pixel and what the future may hold for 4k I can't help but feel the H8000 is the way to go since 90% percent of usage will be PS4 gaming. I love the curve and the price for the 55\" of both models fall well in line with one another, so make the leap or stick with flagship 1080p. Oh and having the NX720,man that is a beautiful display and I wish mine hadn't died on me. "

Particularly that they put the stock sharp level up to 20.....  I get such a clean picture with it set at 0, I feel like they really cranked it for no reason.  Anyhow, I'm on my phone and not able to go through all of the pages easily.  Does anyone have calibration settings for this set?  Using some F8000 settings that look pretty good but would love some settings for the curved panel.  Thanks! "

For such a big set you can really get close to it without noticing the pixels.  The black levels don't degrade super horribly.  I can comfortably watch from the kitchen which puts me at about a 40* angle.  You can tell that the picture is lighter but it's not distracting, not to me at least.

I thought I had wasted 1900.00 dollars. I don't know why it took me so long but today I hit the picture reset button and it fixed it, no flashing in the black bars, background walls are a solid color it's working like it did when it was new.

I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy. "

As stated by others, bright scenes look great however as soon as a dark scene (The Last of Us) is displayed, auto dimming goes crazy and makes it hard to see anything.  My old set, I was able to adjust the white balance by lowering it and turning up the brightness setting, thus passing the auto dimming threshold and tricking the set into thinking the brightness did not require auto dimming.  Has anyone figure out how to trick this model yet?  Cheers. "

Are you referring to auto dimming or local?  Auto dimming will dim the entire picture on darker scenes to give the effect of deeper blacks.  There's usually no setting to change if your TV is equipped with it.  Local Dimming dims just the darker sections, or zones, of the picture, leaving the rest of the scene alone.  It's usually referred to as Smart LED on Samsung Sets and there's a high/low setting.   Anyone with a 65\" H8000 have a TS01 Panel or are they only TD01 Panels?  Do the H8000 Owners with clouding/uniformity problems have U.S. Versions with Local Dimming activated or is it just bad luck? "

The issue I have now is the fluctuation of audio from my Comcast STB when I go to a HD channel with Dolby Digital sound.  Center channel seems to fluctuate.  May have to get a new Pioneer receiver.

I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don't have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000's must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask!       Just the post I was looking for.  I'm looking to upgrade from my LN52A860 (the set that made me fall in love with Samsungs)  but I've been torn after looking at articles on the top gaming TVs.  I really don't want to go back to a Sony. I have no idea what the input lag is on my LN52A860 but I was hoping to improve on it. There is no game mode on the LN52A860 (that I know of). It looks like the only real option from 2014 Samsung models is the H800s. I'm torn between the 55\" or 65\" but my main concern is if the 34-37ms lag is still going to be noticeable. I couldn't find any info on how the LN52A860 rated with input lag so I don't really have any comparison. My other question is how does turning on game mode effect the picture quality? "

		"description": "   Hi All,  I've only ever had Sony's and most recently bought a 65\" X9 4k. The set is amazing in every regard EXCEPT motion resolution. It's ok for tv and films but awful for video games. I suspect this is a combination of high lcd latency and upscaling. Game mode has low input lag but the motion blur is terrible when playing FPS'. I play with interpolation turned on and it helps a good bit but it's still pretty bad, especially on 30fps games, and lag is way up.  So, I'm selling the TV, which is heartbreaking. I use my tv primarily for games and can't deal with the blur. My sony from 2010 was much better in terms of motion but the picture was obviously not nearly as good. I'm seriously considering the Samsung h8000 because my understanding is that Samsung's in general have better motion handling and this particular set is best.  My question is for gamers. What is the motion blur like in game mode and have you played with AMP on? Is it better with a tolerable latency? I don't play competitively so even 100ms doesn't bother me. But motion blur kills the experience. Many gamers said they thought the x9 was great for gaming, but clearly they're not sensitive to blur. I'd love to get some candid responses regarding motion blur and gaming on this set. Thanks!  Jason "

		"description": "   I just read this in the H8000 users manual. Is this something I would really have to worry about?  Still image warning Constantly displaying still pictures can cause image burn-in on the LED screen. Follow the recommendations below: Avoid displaying the same tv channel for long periods. Always try to display any image in full screen. Reduce the brightness and contrast to avoid the appearance of after-images.  Preventing burn-in Avoid keeping a still picture or a picture with static elements(black bars, black borders, logos etc)on your tv for more than two hours at a time. If that's unavoidable, change the picture or change to another channel for a minute or two every couple of hours. Reducing the brightness and contrast of the when it's displaying static elements will also help.  Nowadays  almost every channel has their logo on the screen and most channels have the black letterbox bars. Channels like ESPN(sports ticker)CNN(news ticker &amp; stocks etc)are always displaying.  I'm hoping someone can reassure me that this is not really a problem, I want a tv that I can enjoy watching, not a tv that I constantly have to babysit. I thought image retention and burn-in only happened on plasma tv's. I got rid of a Panasonic plasma for the same reasons listed above. I've had my Sony KDL-46NX720 for 3 years and never noticed any image retention or burn-in at all.  I haven't ordered yet, but if this is going to be a problem then I'll have to pass.  I'm hoping someone can help.  Thanks much. "

There's not a wide variety of panels with the h8000.  65\" has TD01/02 and 55\"/ 46\" have TS01/02.  I've been looking at the 65\" for a while now but keep hearing about slight uniformity issues.  I'm seriously considering the LG55EC9300 OLED that recently came out but really scared of Burn-in/Image Retention. "

Interested to see what the next one will be  I feel like the lower right portion of my panel was just slightly over tightened.  I bet if it were backed off a quarter turn it would be perfect.  If the new one isn't any better I'll place a call to samsung and see if they are willing to send out a technician to try and adjust the panel or replace it until we get one that's suitable.   I was looking at the LG OLED as well but the first amazon review scared me a bit with the bad motion judder under certain situations.  Granted this could probably be fixed with a firmware update but....... ya never know.   I wouldn't be so much worried about IR as it doesn't seem to be an issue.  I'm a long time plasma advocate and if that was manageable I'm sure OLED is even better.   If it were 65\" I'd be all over it.  I'm coming from a 55 and really wanted 65 or larger which I why I was sold on the H8000.   If it weren't for some QC issues I have read about on the F8500 it would have been the clear choice for me.

		"description": "   My 55H8000 arrived today, panel version TS02. I have not noticed any flashlighting/clouding at all. The picture is superb and I haven't even touched the settings yet. The sound is actually quite good although it will benefit greatly from a soundbar/subwoofer system. Standard definition programming through dish network is the best I've ever seen. High definition is out of this world as is blu-ray.  Regarding the curved screen, it took me all of two minutes getting used to it. The curve is very subtle and does provide slightly better off angle viewing. The curvature of the stand is greater than that of the tv itself so it's my thinking that it makes getting used to the curved screen easier.  I'll tinker with the settings over the next few days, but right now I'm going to sit back and enjoy this wonderful tv.  To say I'm happy would be an understatement Well done Samsung. "

After reading most of the H7150 posts it seems it's hit or miss with uniformity problems.  Even among Samsung Panels, (TS01/TH01).  I think a lot of the 7150 owners who claim their set is relatively blemish free are not sure what uniformity is or aren't obsessing over it because there are quite a few reports of Flashlighting and clouding on the S-PVA Panels.       I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy.       How is the Flashlighting on the 8000 in a dark room? "

Still image warning Constantly displaying still pictures can cause image burn-in on the LED screen. Follow the recommendations below: Avoid displaying the same tv channel for long periods. Always try to display any image in full screen. Reduce the brightness and contrast to avoid the appearance of after-images.  Preventing burn-in Avoid keeping a still picture or a picture with static elements(black bars, black borders, logos etc)on your tv for more than two hours at a time. If that's unavoidable, change the picture or change to another channel for a minute or two every couple of hours. Reducing the brightness and contrast of the when it's displaying static elements will also help.  Nowadays  almost every channel has their logo on the screen and most channels have the black letterbox bars. Channels like ESPN(sports ticker)CNN(news ticker &amp; stocks etc)are always displaying.  I'm hoping someone can reassure me that this is not really a problem, I want a tv that I can enjoy watching, not a tv that I constantly have to babysit. I thought image retention and burn-in only happened on plasma tv's. I got rid of a Panasonic plasma for the same reasons listed above. I've had my Sony KDL-46NX720 for 3 years and never noticed any image retention or burn-in at all.  I haven't ordered yet, but if this is going to be a problem then I'll have to pass.  I'm hoping someone can help.  Thanks much.       While it's technically possible to burn in a LCD panel, it's not going to happen. That language is there purely for legal purposes. Burn in just isn't going to happen. Ever. One of the reasons plasmas are going off of the market is due to the burn in resistance of LCDs. And there is nothing different about the Samsung panel that makes it more susceptible.  Trust me, don't think twice about it. I've had lcd monitors playing the same content on loops for years on end without issue (demo material). And if it were an issue, there would be no tv on the market that anyone could buy.  It's entirely possible that language is just a hold over from the manual the company did for their plasma and no-one thought to take it out. "

My UN46D7000 completely gave out and after a lengthy warranty process with Samsung (initiated back in February) they will be delivering the unit shortly. I had the option between this model and the H7150, and chose the larger 48\" curved over the older flat display. Does anyone have any advice upon receipt of the unit? I plan on using my existing wall mount, is that ill-advised? "

If the new one isn't any better I'll place a call to samsung and see if they are willing to send out a technician to try and adjust the panel or replace it until we get one that's suitable.   I was looking at the LG OLED as well but the first amazon review scared me a bit with the bad motion judder under certain situations.  Granted this could probably be fixed with a firmware update but....... ya never know.   I wouldn't be so much worried about IR as it doesn't seem to be an issue.  I'm a long time plasma advocate and if that was manageable I'm sure OLED is even better.   If it were 65\" I'd be all over it.  I'm coming from a 55 and really wanted 65 or larger which I why I was sold on the H8000.   If it weren't for some QC issues I have read about on the F8500 it would have been the clear choice for me. Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk       Did the Flashlighting go away at all with Local Dimming on High?  The LG OLED, (9300), just got a firmware update that supposedly fixed the motion issues.  But, the issues were mainly with owners not activating the Tru-Motion, or whatever LG calls their motion settings, while watching blu rays with a 24/1080p film cadence.  Once turned on, there were no issues but obviously introduced Soap Opera Effect.  New update fixed it. "

After reading lots of posts here I did go in thinking I'd probably buy the 55H7150 but watching both for a while pushed me to the 8000 even at an additional $400.  When I told the sales rep at Best Buy that I wanted a Samsung panel he had no idea that some sets didn't use Samsung panels, nor did the guy that delivered and set it up. Happily it came with a TS02.  I've been without a TV for 14 years and finally recycled the massive, 225 pound Sony monitor, and old electronics to make way for a new setup. I only watch DVDs and Blu-Ray movies on it. Love the picture. I did turn the backlight down to 10.  I think the sound on the set is pretty good for a TV but it is weak in the low end, no shaking the walls. I remembered that my BD player has audio out jacks and one of them is a sub-woofer output so i plugged in my Velodyne sub-woofer built in 1991. Much nicer. I had to put a new foam surround on it as it self destructed on my first movie, Ender's Game. The foam was rotted. Found a repair kit at a company in Southern California. Cost $40 with tax and postage. Sounds great.  Looking to get a Marantz NR1605 for the time being, as the budget is a bit tight after the cost of the TV ;-) "

Hopefully, I made a wise choice. The Bu-ray arrives later in the week.   You should be good with that blu-ray player. Right now I have the Panasonic DMP-BDT500, but might need to replace it soon as I'm starting to get strange artifacts on the right side of my screen on certain movies. Thought at first it was the movies, but tried a friends player and didn't get it. Let me know how you like the Sammy blu-ray player. Might look into that one myself. Let me know how well it handels 3D as well, as that is something I do like and one of the reasons I went with the bd-t500.       Hi Joseph,  This is a late reply but I just recently signed on with AVS Forums.  I watched Prometheus in 3D on my BD-F7500 and thought it did pretty well. The glasses bother some folks eyes or cause headaches but I did alright. I remember 3D movies in the 1950s and never had a problem with them either.  I also tried the 2D &gt; 3D option and it added a bit of depth but not as much as a 3D disk.  The glasses are a bit like sunglasses and make the picture darker which I  don't care for. "

The Bad: It doesn't have as deep a black level as a plasma; it suffers from a slight red push; it has a reflective screen; Yahoo apps aren't very slick; and the remote sensor isn't very responsive. The Bottom Line: The Vizio M-Series offers a potent combination of excellent design, decent picture quality, and a pocket-friendly price.'  You get what you pay for.  If your satisfied with a little less picture quality and apps, a little lower quality of the passive 3D image, a picture that doesn't pop like it's cheaper E-Series TV, then you are welcome to buy a lower quality set.  Good picture, but not better than a Samsung. "

I am amped for the P-series Vizio right now, but share the same concerns with Vizio use of the term full array. I have owned the HX929 from Sony and that was a hell of a set. While H8000 is an edge based dimmer, samsung has a rather impressive implementation. I am optimistic for the P-series, but will likely end up with the H8000 @ 1080p or the HU7250 (curved) or HU8550 (flat)@ 4k. "

If i connect a devices like bd / ps3 / setup box tv/  and play this, i have for about a second, an audio drop out (the picture instead is perfect), about 7 minutes from the time to tv is switched on and then, the same thing for every 3 minutes and 30-35 seconds. This issue is very regular, so i suspect a firmware bug (the last 1141 is already instelled), but i'm not very sure and could be my tv set defective also. I already done a tv reset Someone found  the same problem? Or someone can try to use component input?  Thanks a lot "

		"description": "   The 65\" UN65H8000AFXZA curved panel is very good, no banding or clouding or bleeding issues. I also like the upscaled standard definition TV (dish network), flesh tones could be improved but I have left the picture setting at movie. I had tried the recommended settings in the other thread here but they did not work for me. However the Smart Hub firmware has bugs!, I have rebooted this TV 5 times in last week since I purchased it.1st Issue: (2nd day) Had connected this TV via ethernet but it lost connection to network, removed ethernet and tried via wireless but it could not be fixed, even by resetting the Smart Hub, had to power it off as per instructions from customer support. User guide says that Cat 7 ethernet cables are required but I only have Cat 5e cables so will have to try later with Cat 7.2nd Issue: (3rd day) The wifi lost internet connection, was not resolved by resetting smart hub however resetting the TV fixed it.3rd issue: (6th day) The netflix app stopped working, resetting smart hub did not fix it but resetting the TV fixed it. Will try this TV for 1 more week, if it continues to have problems then it is going back to store Samsung customer service could not tell me if this TV hasBluetooth LE (4.0) CPU Speed (quad core plus means what?) Total Ram (not flash storage)  It currently says 349.8 MB used out of 1.22 GB If anyone knows these specifications, kindly reply.EDIT: Jun 4, 2014 Netflix problem was resolved after talking to netflix support. BTW if you want to go into service menu, the code is Press Mute followed by 1, 8, 2, PWR, the TV will shutdown and restart with Service menu overlay. Be EXTREMELY careful playing around with service menu, there are several posts on AVS forum where people have bricked their sets after changing values. - Have successfully paired Logitech Bluetooth keyboard however most of the apps do not support keyboard for text entry. - This TV does NOT allow Bluetooth audio playback. (Actually none of the smart TV sets support it, this was confirmed by Samsung customer service) Samsung recommends connecting wireless headsets to Audio out port. I am fairly happy with the set after fixing Netflix glitch. The disappointments are (not necessarily with Samsung): 1. Lack of Bluetooth audio I cannot understand why samsung could not put an audio driver for the BT chipset, they support keyboard, mouse, smart remote via bluetooth so why not AUDIO!! IMHO it was a very stupid decision by TV department to exclude BT Audio. 2. APPS a) Apps do not have consistent data entry i.e. very few apps support smart remote, for others you have to use regular remote. It is very frustrating to juggle between two remotes, netflix supports smart remote but almost every other app I have tried requires the use of regular remote with Red, Blue, Green and Yellow keys. b) Keyboard panel in apps for text entry is not consistent E.G. Netflix - The Login Id/Passwd uses regular QWERTY mode but for searching it switches to ABCD mode! This is a samsung issue though because their SDK should NOT expect app developers to fiddle with keyboard layout. c) The weather channel: If you can setup multiple locations without cursing the app then you have far more patience than me d) TV/Movies Section It would tell you if a show is available on Vudu or Hulu to rent/buy but will not show if it is available on netflix or Amazon. How can it not connect to netflix or amazon using their API to search? e) Removing Apps If anyone finds out how to remove pre-installed apps then please let me know e.g. M2Go Samsung App panel developers, please get your act together!! Don't get me wrong, I am fairly happy with the \"TV\" but when I am buying a Smart TV, I expected a bit more polished experience. Feel free to ask any other questions. "

As far as the F8000.. the reviews I read stated pretty significant uniformity issues without engaging the local dimming (but excellent uniformity after that was engaged). For those that had no issues even with it turned off I guess it may have been luck of the draw. I know I was pretty unlucky with my first 60in 7100 and 2 Sony 850As. But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.  \u00a0 So we're on the same page: Smart LED feature == \"Precision Black\" == local dimming Micro Dimming Ultimate == software-based video processing. It's not really local dimming of the LEDs at all. \u00a0 The US versions\u00a0of the\u00a0F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate as well as\u00a0Precision Black local dimming. The UK and\u00a0Canadian versions of the F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate, but NOT Precision Black local dimming. \u00a0 The UK version of the H8000 that was reviewed has no hardware-based local dimming. It's an actual difference in the hardware, not just software. To make things more confusing, the Canadian H8000 webpage says \"Precision Black (Local Dimming) Available\". So there's probably two different versions of the TV in Canada. \u00a0 That\u00a0AVForums H8000 review\u00a0is a bit confusing: \"The also H8000 doesn't include Samsung's Smart LED feature which is a shame because it really helps with the perceived blacks but its absence is consistent with last year's F8000 model. However the local dimming was very effective, expertly handling our usual assortment of torture tests.\"\u00a0They seem\u00a0to imply that the UK H8000 they tested has local dimming, which it doesn't. I'm guessing they were actually referring to F8000 and the fact that its local dimming is effective. \u00a0 FWIW, my Canadian UN55F8000, which has no local dimming, has no issues with uniformity.  "

		"description": "   Regarding your question about gaming mode on the H8000. The review on avforums indicated:\u201cThe H8000 delivered a sizeable input lag of 120ms when in the calibrated Movie mode but thankfully things improved dramatically when the Game mode was selected. This brought the input lag down to 34ms which whilst not the lowest we've measured - Sony appear to be the leaders in this area at the moment - should be low enough for all but the most demanding of gamers. Unlike the HU8500, renaming the input didn't make any difference to the lag but 34ms is amongst the best we have measured recently. Certainly we didn't notice any appreciable delay when gaming on the H8000 and overall we found it to be quite responsive, although our reactions might not be as cat-like as many others. If you sat quite close to the display, the curved nature of the screen could also help to make the gaming experience slightly more immersive\u201d. This review indicated the input lag in Gaming mode is identical to that specified in the avforums review:\"Samsung has reduced the input lag on the 55H8000 compared with last year\u2019s 55F8000, though it\u2019s still behind the class-leading Sony Bravias. Our Leo Bodnar input lag tester returned a figure of 34ms in [Game] mode; and a much less gaming-friendly 119ms in [Movie] mode.\" This review recorded an input lag lower than 34ms:\"After the rather disappointing 60ms-plus input lag reading recorded on the UE65HU8500, it\u2019s great to see the UE55H8000 only hitting a much more gaming-friendly figure of 33ms.\"  The User Manual on the Canadian web site indicates that the television does indeed have a gaming mode. Further, the topic titled \u201cEnabling Game Mode\u201d provides instructions for accessing this feature. For your reference, here is the sequence: MENU &gt;System &gt; General &gt; Game Mode Try Now. There are a few warnings about Game Mode in the User Manual:Game Mode cannot be used for normal TV viewing. Connect the gaming console before enabling Game Mode. Otherwise, the picture quality may suffer. The screen may shake a little. Enabling Game Mode automatically sets the Picture Mode to Standard and the Sound Mode to Movie. To use a different external device, first disconnect the game console and disable Game Mode.  Hope this helps. Looking forward to more reviews. My 55H8000 arrives today. "

The \"H\" has more dimming zones and a better processor for smart hub. I did see the Sharp and it does look good but a lot of reviews from Amazon are so so. Mainly dead/stuck pixels. It is a Sharp Panel so I wouldn't be surprised to see purplish blacks, ghosting, and uniformity issues. "

High definition and blu-ray are nothing short of spectacular. I was watching football on Sunday and the hi def images were razor sharp and crystal clear. In close-up shots of the field you could almost count the blades of grass. I saw no motion blur at all especially when the camera pans during a long pass.  Regarding what Ken said about the \"fault finders\" once they find a fault then they can't unsee it. The best way to avoid that is to not look for it. Just sit back and enjoy what is surely the best(IMHO)1080p HDTV on the market today.  "

They also have free shipping and a 60 money  back guarantee. You also get lifetime technical support at no extra cost. I have bought 4 televisions from them and every one arrived in perfect condition. They use UPS freight for shipping.  Depending on where you live, shipping takes 2 to 3 days. Visit their site and call them. You can place your order over the phone which is the way I ordered mine. They are a first class operation and will answer any questions you might have. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.        I live in KC.  Do you know if they charge tax? "

Anyways, as mentioned early impressions are good and it seems like all thew H8000s come with a sammy panel so that's good.

Yes all US sets will have the selectable Smart LED setting.  They actually added this setting in via a software update, I believe first production sets had it permanently enabled like non-USA sets.

Color processing, noise reduction, advanced scaling, all of these aspects and more get thrown out or greatly reduced\". So, the Game mode on the H8000 follows the industry standard to reduce input lag. There are a number of good articles available. Just Google Game Mode. "

		"description": "   I have now set up my H8000, and all I can say is \u201cwow\u201d. The unboxing indicated the care that Samsung take when packaging and shipping their products. The screen was very well protected and the all of the accessories were provided in a separate box. A cleaning cloth was provided, which I thought was a nice touch. The chrome accent strip around the screen and the stand were well protected with plastic film. I recently set up a new Sony television, and the Samsung experience provided a greater sense that someone was paying attention to the details. I have not had time to test the settings provided in a previous post, but picture quality in Movie mode is amazing. I played Master and Commander (an old favorite) tonight and it was stunning. SD video looks very good and Netflix movies look equally good. My only (minor) criticism is that the stand seems a little flimsy. Also, the screen seems prone to reflection from our floor lamps. Small issues. Overall, I would give this television an 8.5 or a 9 out of 10 for picture quality, construction, ease of operation, and features. Most of the reviews I have read to date seem to concur with this assessment. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from other owners. "

You should be good with that blu-ray player. Right now I have the Panasonic DMP-BDT500, but might need to replace it soon as I'm starting to get strange artifacts on the right side of my screen on certain movies. Thought at first it was the movies, but tried a friends player and didn't get it. Let me know how you like the Sammy blu-ray player. Might look into that one myself. Let me know how well it handels 3D as well, as that is something I do like and one of the reasons I went with the bd-t500. "

After about 2 minutes we both agreed - that's the one! \u00a0 Long story short - I was ready to buy the 50\"\u00a0but my wife said no -\u00a0let's go for the 65\" ... and\u00a0for a lot\u00a0less money than\u00a0the 4K Curved. \u00a0 So, we're picking it up tomorrow morning ... Product Code: UN65H8000AF. \u00a0 I'll report back later with my impressions when I get it home and tweak it up.   So... How is the new tv?  "

		"description": "   Sorry Everyone for not getting back sooner ... It's been overwhelming getting this unit set up and we love this TV so much now we can't stop watching / fiddling with it. \u00a0 It needs a minimal amount of tinkering out of the box - that's nothing new ...\u00a0After changing to 'Movie' mode, that was really all it took to get a decent picture that I watched all afternoon. \u00a0 Yea, we spent the whole entire afternoon watching French Open Tennis - Sorry! \u00a0 Then yesterday we had to go back to Best Buy (Canada) and buy a TV stand to go with it ... (Whalen BBCXL54-NV - Reg: $269.00 / Paid: $199.00) ... So, we spent the 2nd day putting that together and watching more TV (I'm an old retired guy so I need to take breaks)\u00a0 \u00a0 I did notice some motion judder / stuttering in the fast tennis action but it wasn't overly bad ... Just the same, I went to &lt;Auto Motion Plus&gt; under Picture --&gt; Options and changed the setting to &lt;Standard&gt; - I saw no more stuttering after that.\u00a0 \u00a0 Also, at first - the 65\" was kind of overwhelming even at 10 feet away ... coming from a 50\" Panasonic Viera plasma - Not a shabby TV either. In any case now with a viewing distance of 12' - I love it and don't think we'll ever go to the movie theater again. \u00a0 \u00a0 Just some facts and observations now ... \u00a0 Model: UN65H8000AFXZC / Panel: TS01 No dead / stuck pixels \u00a0 Best Buy: List Price - $3799.99 and includes a Samsung Galaxy TABPRO 10.1\" Tablet (worth $520.00) ... {FYI - This is expensive and was an ok deal ONLY because I wanted the TABPRO 10.1\" - 2560x1600} \u00a0 Measured Power: 2 Watts in STANDBY ... 145 Watts while ON ... Measured using the BluePlanet EM100 Energy Meter {FYI - The old Viera plasma ran between 480 - 550 Watts ... No kidding} \u00a0 Picture wise: It looks fabulous! ... However, I did notice some small back light bleed around the edge and some uneven lighting when viewing a black screen but take that with a grain of salt since I don't (yet) have a calibration disc so I can't be really sure of what I'm looking at and the thing is not totally set up yet. \u00a0 I did NOT notice any banding - none in any viewing done over these few days. \u00a0 One thing I can mention - I used HDMI-1 for Bell Satellite (PVR) and HDMI-2 for the Bluray player for movie viewing ... By default, the unit is configured to change settings on ALL inputs - change this to apply setting changes to affect only the input your viewing - If that's what you want ... I wasted a few hours tinkering with the Bluray for movies and went to the PVR input and tinkered there and lost all my Bluray settings - Argggh. \u00a0 Last word - I watched a few minutes of 'Lawrence of Arabia' on Bluray - I guess they can't make 'em like that any more - Anyway, the visuals are stunning but on this set they are jaw-dropping (My 2 cents) \u00a0 Let me know if you want any other info but it may take a while to report back - Once you turn on the H8000 Curved - It ain't easy to walk away.

But haven't noticed them during regular playback. My TV is in a low light viewing area and I had a smidge of clouding that I eliminated by turning down the backlight a bit and I have on Smart LED (standard) I've heard there are issues with apps in the smart hub, but I don't use those so I couldn't speak to that. I would definitely recommend this TV if you are looking for a non 4k TV! Panel is a TD02. "

Looking forward to seeing some recommended settings (even though every TV is different). "

But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.       Hi Neo,  As to the panel version, look on the end of the packing box. There should be an area that tells you the Model and serial number as well as the Version:, that may be a TS01 or TS02... Or you can find the label on the back of the set on the opposite side of the connector inputs.  I'm one of those folks who likes the curved screen. My engineer brain points out that when I look from the center out to the edges, from where I sit, the distance is almost the same. So what that means is the pixels are straight on, seems optimal to me. If I do the same with a flat screen, as I look to the edges I am looking at an ever increasing angle, i.e. the distance is further away as I look to the edges, just like moving off to the side from dead center. Just my view of the curved screen. I love my 55H8000.  The sound is much better also as I finally have my Denon 4520CI all hooked up. Just need to do a bit of clean up and run Audyssey. Even so, it sounds pretty nice  Also thinking of adding a second subwoofer, maybe SVS SB-2000 or SVS PC-2000... Although after watching U-571 last night I'm not sure I need anymore impact during the depth charge attack "

I bought this model to both get a better TV and to avoid the H7150 panel lottery. How do I tell which panel is in my TV?  So I don't know how to set this TV up. I want a setting for movies and a setting for games. But this is problematic as my game system is my movie player. Hmmmm. So which settings do I do? I could not select PC label at all, which is better for input lag, but I could rename it manually to PC which I did. The text from 1080p TV seems blocky. In fact the picture so far seems to have a fine pixel staircase look to it. Not sure if this is normal.  Picture looks great otherwise, I just think I need to adjust some settings.   Edit:  Seems the blocky picture is only on my HD DVR recording of \"The Flash\" or CW HD itself. An ABC HD recording I had on my DVR has a nice non blocky logo. The people don't have jagged edges to faces like CW... What the hell CW?  Edit 2:  Btw this TV has exceeded my expectations in build quality and picture so far. Of course it's also the most money I've ever spent on a TV as well. Well worth it. I don't even mind the curve, kinda looks neat in my bedroom when I come in. But while watching my mind flattens the picture so there is no big performance benefit on a 55\" curved TV. Very excited to play a game or watch a Blu Ray.       For gaming you don't need to set an input name to PC on this particular TV.  To get the benefits of lower input lag on any input you just enable the \"Game Mode\" setting in your general settings menu.  This will allow you to be able to also have your Movie mode setup appropriately even if the input is from your game console, just make sure Game Mode is turned off and that your picture mode is set to Movie.  Then when you want to play a game just flip on Game Mode.  I noticed on my set that they way over - sharpen the image out of the box.  I believe movie mode was set to like 50 and standard was set to like 20 out of the box or vice versa. If your input sources are good you will NEVER need your sharpening set to anything past 5 in my experience.  I keep sharpening off completely for any modes coming out of my PS4 and 5 sharpening for my standard mode which I use for cable TV.  Looks fantastic!!  One last note.  For the absolute best image quality make sure you set your picture size to \"screen fit\" which will ensure that you get perfect 1:1 pixel mapping from your sources.

I managed to walk out of there with the TV and 4 year warranty for the $1799 price. I was pretty stoked...until I got home. The ghosting on this TV was absolutely horrible! I returned the TV yesterday and was hesitant to bring home another fearing similar issues. Of course the Black Friday sale wasn't going on any longer but there are still a few TV's on sale. I noticed the UN55HU8000 on sale for $1899. Not a 4K but I really only went for the 4K based on the price. I managed to get the HU8000 at the exact deal I got on the HU7250 so I'm happy.  Now who has some killer settings!? "

		"description": "   I've had this tv for 10 days and I really like the picture. I find  have to adjust the picture settings here and there as there does not seem to be any standard when it comes to viewing.  I got the U65HN8000 for $1750, on Black Friday. It was listed at $2000 sale price on the web page, so I got a deal.  If it wasn't for that price, I probably would have taken it back and got a Vizio or something else far cheaper or the same price for something bigger. Its such a nice picture, I wish I could afford the next size up. 3D is pretty neat, but I doubt I'll use it that much. I bought Avatar 3D so I'm looking forward to watching.  Changing 2D to 3D is a snap and the effect is pretty good. Football is pretty wild watching in 3D. I get a little tired in the eyes and figure its something I will have to build up an endurance to I find the Samsung Smart Hub to be a joke. There are very few apps the average person would ever use. You cant do a search for them and you are limited to what Samsung posts.  Poor and little selection. The Face Book app is horrible. It doesn't look anything like any app I've seen before. I like the web browser and it is easy to use. Web pages look fantastic and easy to read The remote is neat, but I would rather have a keypad on it, not the one you have to point to on the tv and hope you can type fast enough. Lots of connections in the back and very easy to change the source with the remote. Sound is pretty good for such a thin tv. It sounds way better hung on the wall. All in all, the picture is great, but I don't think the average viewer would be upset with todays lesser priced TV's. I'd like to get a DVD and calibrate it properly. I've tried everyones different settings and have tweeked them a bit. Bottom line, if you get the tv for a good price, you will be happy.

If it's dark, ( night scene), their faces have a great hue to them and look normal but if it's light out or they're in their kitchen the faces look washed out.  It's the same with outdoor scenes on live action shows as well.  Bumping the color up fixes it a little.  Could it it be the contrast is too high? "

Most channels are fine and it's really only American Dad that seems washed out but only when there's a predominantly WHITE background.  I did have to push the COLOR Setting up to 60.  Everything else is at it's default setting other than Cinema Black (high), Dynamic Contrast (low), and Smart LED (high).  Picture Setting is on Standard. "

Noticed clouding in the top a little to the side of the right corner, but with smart led + cinema black, it's completely gone when watching content  Color and blacks as well as motion are all superb in movie mode with some adjustments. It's a shame this TV has seemingly gone under the radar in favour of the 4Ks as I suspect if compared directly their real life performance would be close to the same. "

		"description": "   Ive been a Sony guy for the longest time, but there's some things here that are really changing my tune.  The cinema black feature is a godsend. Corner light bleed and flashlighting is something that's killed me on my 55W900 and on the 65X900Bs ive been looking at. The Cinema Black feature does an amazing job at keeping blacks pitch black on letter bars even in a pitch black room. Im shocked, I figured only OLED could cure this issue (plasma aside).  The local dimming is pretty crazy here as well, credits, in a pitch black room with smart led enabled, I barely see any light blooming whatsoever around the lettering, unlike the Sonys, and black levels overall are phenomenal (tested Prometheus, scenes set in space, star fields looked phenomenal considering this is edge lit).  Also, something minor, but with speakers set to audio out, there is no popup whatsoever when using my Samsung smart remote to control my external speaker.  Other than that, motion is on point, couldnt be happier with it, gaming performance on gaming mode is excellent, no noticeable lag.  This TV has it all. "

AA Before you jump ship try another 55H8000 as you are clearly not happy with this one. All of the problems you are describing, I see absolutely none of them on my 55 inch. The only picture setting I don't like is dynamic. The other three settings are perfectly ok with me. I have been happy with mine since the day I got it and still haven't tweaked any settings except changing to the movie setting.  As far as your washed out colors, it may be your cable feed. Remember this saying? Garbage in, garbage out. Well it is definitely true and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  I think you should ask Amazon for an exchange and give the 55H8000 another chance. If you still aren't happy then you'll know that you didn't give up easily.  "

		"description": "     Hello. Per reviews I've read and recommendations on this forum I decided to buy the 55\" H8000 HDTV. I must say I'm quite pleased with it. THERE IS a difference between the H8000 and my former 32F6300 in terms of image quality. It's just a pleasure to watch it.  As one of the main purposes of my tv is to play video games (mostly PC games via my PC and some PS4 ones) and being accustomed to the great performance in that matter of my F6300 I must say the H8000 is quite as good as the F6300 but the F6300 still leads in terms of lag but the differente is nothing to talk about. In fact all reviews have given the H8000 a GREAT test result in gaming performance and I agree.  The PC mode works fantastically well. I am attaching two photos I took while playing Max Payne 3 with my PC all settings at full. The image and sense of immersion is really UNBELIEVABLES. Words cannot describe the feeling you just got to experience it first hand. The imperfections/pixelations shonw in the photos are because of my iPhone camera NOT the TV.  The only bad thing is that yesterday, just one week after buying it I discovered a RED STUCK PIXEL right in the middle of the screen that is quite noticiable although it's only one. Of course it's noticeable mostly only in dark/black screens but this tv it's a beauty showing black images so that's really a pity.  I read stuck pixels are more treatable than dead pixels. I tried the jscreenfix solution for about 20 minutes and although the intensity of the red stuck pixel diminished it went back again after some time. Then I tried this other site: www.flexcode.org and I noticed that just starting it the red stuck pixel light diminished more and then I left it also for about 20 minutes. The light have diminished but still there and last time I saw there was no light. It was very late at night so I couldn't keep trying but before turning off the TV I almost saw no light on the red stuck pixel. I don't know if the stuck pixel will come back but at least it diminished with said methods and that is saying something. Hopefully I can fix it. Though I'm a little OCD about it it's certainly disturbing to have said stuck pixel. "

I did get reflection from the lights in the room opposite the tv. This was very distracting. You could see a red ribbon across the top of the screen and sometimes a rainbow effect. Since then, I have wall mounted in a room with no windows. Fortunately, the light in that room is behind the tv and the main light is protected from view by a ceiling drop. Without any reflection on the screen, I get little to no glare. The walls are painted dark brown behind the tv and side walls are a bit lighter brown to help with a theatre setting.

Its such a nice picture, I wish I could afford the next size up. 3D is pretty neat, but I doubt I'll use it that much. I bought Avatar 3D so I'm looking forward to watching.  Changing 2D to 3D is a snap and the effect is pretty good. Football is pretty wild watching in 3D. I get a little tired in the eyes and figure its something I will have to build up an endurance to I find the Samsung Smart Hub to be a joke. There are very few apps the average person would ever use. You cant do a search for them and you are limited to what Samsung posts.  Poor and little selection. The Face Book app is horrible. It doesn't look anything like any app I've seen before. I like the web browser and it is easy to use. Web pages look fantastic and easy to read The remote is neat, but I would rather have a keypad on it, not the one you have to point to on the tv and hope you can type fast enough. Lots of connections in the back and very easy to change the source with the remote. Sound is pretty good for such a thin tv. It sounds way better hung on the wall. All in all, the picture is great, but I don't think the average viewer would be upset with todays lesser priced TV's. I'd like to get a DVD and calibrate it properly. I've tried everyones different settings and have tweeked them a bit. Bottom line, if you get the tv for a good price, you will be happy.        "

Standard is ok only if I bump the color from 50 to 70 but then everything is over saturated.  Natural is the best but it crushes blacks on video games.  Movie is not for me.  My 3 year old Samsung ccfl Lcd has an SQ01 Panel and the colors are spot on, vibrant,  and flesh tones are amazing.  The ES8000, which I had briefly, was a TS01 Panel and the picture was identical to my older Samsung.  Bad clouding was the reason I took it back.  Could see clearly during the day.       AA Before you jump ship try another 55H8000 as you are clearly not happy with this one. All of the problems you are describing, I see absolutely none of them on my 55 inch. The only picture setting I don't like is dynamic. The other three settings are perfectly ok with me. I have been happy with mine since the day I got it and still haven't tweaked any settings except changing to the movie setting.  As far as your washed out colors, it may be your cable feed. Remember this saying? Garbage in, garbage out. Well it is definitely true and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  I think you should ask Amazon for an exchange and give the 55H8000 another chance. If you still aren't happy then you'll know that you didn't give up easily.        I'm still debating.  I really don't want to give up the black levels and uniformity but the picture is driving me nuts.  I have a rule of thumb, if i have to fiddle with settings for more than 5 minutes to get a good picture then there's something wrong with the TV.  I've had at least 10 high end and mid range tvs over the last 8 years, a few got returned, and the ones I kept took me 2-4 minutes to realize if it was good or not. "

You're a GENIUS!!!! I followed your advised and based on said advise grab just a little more information and used a pencil (on the eraser side) and double covered it with a soft microfiber cloth I use to clean my glasses. I placed the pencil eraser (covered as I said) exactly on the stuck pixel very firmly and shut down my TV. Once the TV was shut down I pressed it even more firmly (something I have never done to any tv before) and turned on the TV and the pixel was still there but barely there. So, I repeated the procedure once again \"pressing\" the pixel even harder than before, kept it that away for about 10 seconds and then turned on again the tv. Then, like playing a tablet game there was still a very little part of the pixel (it was now moving like if it was alive!) and without turning off the tv or pressing hard, just touched said pixel and then it was gone!!!  I've been using the TV playing movies and stuff (I haven't turn it down yet because I'm working with my PC on the same room) and the stuck pixel is not there. The all black, all blue screens where the pixel was most noticeable shows no stuck pixel. Just a few minutes ago I played the same movie in the same scene that was when I discovered the stuck pixel and it's not there. In other words: the stuck pixel is gone!!!! I just couldn't believe you just could literally \"erase\" a stuck pixel!!!!!  Your post was so assuring and helpful!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! "

Has anyone ever bought what essentially sounds like an open box item from a 3rd party seller on Amazon?       Number one: I would never buy anything from a third party seller. Number two: If it sounds to good to be true, it probably isn't. Number three: Do yourself a huge favor(if you can afford to)and only buy if it ships directly from Amazon. Number four: If you have the opportunity, audition one in person at a big box store like Best Buy, Abt, PCRichard, HHGregg etc.  And finally, I would never buy an open box, no matter how attractive the price  Of course, you are entitled to do what you wish, but I'm hoping you will take my four points into consideration.  One more thing. I can strongly recommend Crutchfield. They are an authorized retailer. They offer a 60 day money back guarantee, free shipping and free lifetime tech support. I have bought numerous products from them and their customer service is excellent.   "

The picture is amazingly more crisp and sharp from the factory settings. One thing I wanted to ask is there a way to make the picture quality less \"Soap Operaish\"? I remember I bought a LG led, and that was was the worst Soap Opera effect setting I have encountered but there was a setting which allowed it to take it off. Is there something for the Samsung as well? Thanks to everyone for sharing there experience with this tv set on this thread. "

Cheers!       I hope you're right!  When you go to enable game mode though, it even says in the little description box \"There may be a slight degradation in graphic quality.\"  That's the understatement of the century.  I swear it makes my PS3 games look like PS2 games, and completely destroys the vibrant colors this TV is capable of producing in the other modes.  Everything looks flat, like on a cheap Vizio.  Why would they need to dumb down the colors in order to reduce input lag??  Anyway, Samsung is supposedly going to have someone contact me to try and find a solution.  If they can't, I've already made up my mind that I'm going to swap the H8000 for a Sony KDL50W800B instead (same TV as I had before, only bigger &amp; 120hz).  Sad because I know the KDL50W800B will be inferior to the Samsung in every other way, but the game mode on the H8000 is just not going to work for me unless there's some sort of workaround. "

		"description": "   Ok, so I think I'm the first person on here to purchase one of the Asian model numbers of this set. Mine is: UA65H8000 with a TS01 panel. TV looks beautiful, but I'm having trouble with the HDMI inputs. I have 3 sources I want to connect to it:  1) Set Top Box 2) Windows 7 PC 3) PlayStation 4  Set Top seems to be required to go into HDMI input 1. No problem. Works great.  The Windows PC works fine plugged into HDMI input 4. But plugging it in to inputs 2 or 3 results in the screen resolution dropping to only 640x480. Windows displays it as a generic display with no option to set the resolution correctly. But through HDMI input 4 all is well and normal.  The PS4 was originally plugged into HDMI input 2. I've heard others use this successfully. But when I plug it it, the picture is fine, but there is no sound. The same happens when I plug it into input 3. I tried everything to fix it, swapping out cables, switching inputs, trying different audio settings on the PS4, turning things on and off. Apparently there is an issue with the 2.0 firmware update on the PS4 sometimes causing there to be an issue with the audio output over HDMI.  However, if I plug the PS4 into HDMI input 4, then the sound returns and everything works fine! Of course the problem now is that if I want to switch from the PC to the Playstation, I have to manually unplug and replug the HDMI cables. I had assumed that an HDMI input is basically and HDMI input and they they were relatively standard and interchangeable. There was no issue on my 5 year old LG TV this Samsung replaced.  So... any workarounds or suggestions for how I could get both the Playstation and Windows PC both plugged into the TV and functioning correctly? "

Thanks guys, please respond ASAP if possible.       I've had the UN65H8000 TV over a month and I really love it. I was exactly in the same boat before purchase. I am happy with my decision. I had the same concerns.  This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn't disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn't make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don't even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven't tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn't much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that's why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( &gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money. "

I used the Cnet settings for the F9000 and tweaked it slightly to suit my personal tastes. I tried looking on Cnet for similar settings for my H8000 but couldnt find anything - does anyone know if the settings I've used on my F9000 would be compatible with the H8000? "

I had some Pixelation/Graininess on the picture. This went away when I switched from \"Dynamic\" to  \"Movie\" mode. However now the picture seems dull/darlk and washed out. The colors aren't vibrant at all.  Are there some sort of setting to deal with this? Perhaps manual calibration or something?  Anyone else running HTPC on this TV?  Regards,   Tomas "

It's not my cables or my setup because I have an older TV currently in our living room with the same cables and setup and it looks great.  I'm going to get either the 55h7150 or the 55h6400 in the next few days.  I've heard the h7150 has bad flashlighting but the 55\" seems to be the best in uniformity.  The h6400 is mainly a failsafe if the 7150 doesn't work out.  Thanks for all the info over the last 6 months.       AA Sorry it didn't work out for you. I guess that's why they call it the panel lottery. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you don't. I hope whichever you decide on(7150 or 6400)works out for the best.  Good luck  "

Both looked great to me.  Looking at 2D immediately afterwards sure looks \"flat\"  Next 3D features in my lineup; Pacific Rim, Upside Down and Gravity. I've watched Pacific Rim and Gravity in 2D and looking forward to seeing them in 3D. These movies have pretty good bass tracks and I'm ready for that too.

I can deal with lighter black levels or uneven uniformity but a dull/lifeless/faded picture will get sent back every time.  I understand the limitations of \"LCD\" TVs.  Plasma sucks, IMO.  TVs, just like color, beauty, music, movies, and food are subjective.  What's good for you is not good for me and vice versa.  I'm glad you've found your perfect set.  I have one that's perfect but it's a 46\" and I need one that's 55\" for our living room.  Didn't one of you return your set for minor clouding/flashlighting?   You knew the limitations so why did you exchange it?  You were after that perfect set and it appears you got it. "

I just couldn't believe you just could literally \"erase\" a stuck pixel!!!!!  Your post was so assuring and helpful!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!       Happy it worked out for you!  Now enjoy that beast.  Sent from my HTC One (M8) using Tapatalk "

This is the best 1080p model on the market if you want to go to 4K then 8550 is good choice, however I believe 9000 is the best due to extra features(PurColor technology etc). I had a big concern before purchase that how 65 inch screen of H8000 or H8550 would handle SD contents but it didn't disappoint me, it makes them look nice and watchable on H8000 not garbage. Here are the answers to your questions.  Curved TV doesn't make objects curvy otherwise everything would look weird (imagine beautiful slim girl what would happen to them , who would like to see that ?  ) . The only thing it does probably add (imaginary) depth to an overall scene. It looks good on the Wall (unless looking from 180 degree). As most people said you get used to the curve and don't even notice it after a while. There is no problem viewing from side of the TV in fact it  improves side viewing a little.  I did have some clouding but after adjusting backlight (8-10) it is not noticeable other than that no other issues (I haven't tried rubbing with microfiber cloth yet).  It all comes down to money all three are beautiful sets and one got advantages over other. (H8000 vs H7150) H8000 has hardware local dimming/Upgrade option/Better processor (if there isn't much price difference like around 100-150$ then H8000 is the way to go. All the reviews were done in mid last year when there was lot of price difference that's why people were recommending H7150 over H8000 (not worth to pay extra 500$ for Curve.  (H8550 vs H8000) H8550 has 4K advantage other than that not many advantages but it does have panel lottery issue (H8550 is reported to also use non-samsung panels) whereas all H8000 is using only samsung panels. If there is much price difference ( &gt; 500$ ) then I think its better to save them for now and spend them later after few years when 4K contents available and 4K TVs will have better technology as seen from CES 2015 it is already improved this year. But if you want to keep your TV for many years to come ( over 5-7 years) then probably H8550 is worth extra money.       You had me fully convinced to get the H8000 but then you said the hu8550 at the very end lol. I tried the hu8550 already and it had ghosting issues and audio sync problems. I don't know if I just had a bad hu8550 or if this problem will persist. Everything else was really nice on the TV though. SO basically it is ust down to the hu8550 and the H8000. It also sucks to buy a TV right now because I know Samsung will be releasing new TVs in late March I was told. "

I'm trying to get the most out of the settings and, even if it's a fairly new tv, I haven't got much help from the internet in terms of calibrations. I'm using the tv as a pc monitor and learned it's a good idea to rename HDMI to PC, I did it, but find the image is kind of lacking in something I can't put my finger on. It looks blurrier than before?  I know all tv:s should be treated individually, but does anyone of you know the best settings for pc mode, game mode (both on pc and ps3) and movie mode for this particular model? I'm currently using pc mode for browsing the internet, but when it comes to watching videos or movies there must be a better way, should I always switch to movie mode when I open a video on youtube for example?  Bear with me, I'm really new with these kinds of tv:s. Any help would be appreciated! "

My Directv channels vary quite a bit - HBO, Showtime, BBCA look consistently great, while other shows - especially dark looking ones, like 'Sleepy Hollow' can have significant blocky artifacts in dark areas. And some shows look sharp and in focus, while others look soft. But Blu-Rays look fine, so I believe it is not the set, but the quality of the broadcast from Directv, which of course is compressed quite a bit.  Have you tried calibrating your set? I have been able to both improve the Directv picture and hide many of the artifacts by changing the settings on mine. "

But when I watch a movie via my computer(connecting like a second screen) I am not happy with the results at all. Its a bit choppy, nothing like the tests at the shop. It feels like the hz is very low and I get frustrated and instead just watches the movie on my computer screen.  I also tried copying the movie over on an usb and tried connecting to the tv, same issue, not impressed.  Is there any settings I can change? After 2 years back and forth with phillips I'm so feckin angry I could explode. Why won't my tv just work? "

Im tempted to exchange this set for a 70LB7100 LG.. but i see a lot of mixed reviews for it I tried playing some movies from my laptop connected to the tv via HDMI cable.. and it did look like crap I transferred some of the movies over to an external drive, and connected it directly to the tv using USB.. and they played significantly better..

		"description": "   Hey Imoen if you are still around... I set up an exchange with Best Buy and then quickly canceled it after I saw these comments from another thread in here for a similar tv and then played around with them  My general settings where I get no flash lighting are Standard, brightness 34, backlight 3-7 (night time, nice and dark) but change it to 10-15 (daytime when blinds are open. I will notice flash lighting when I go 7+ on backlight or higher than 34 on the brightness), Contrast 90, Eco mode off, Dynamic Contrast LOW (This I feel pops the picture slightly without losing detail in the color gradients any higher I notice the grey bar deviate too much from the true picture), and Dark for the black level ( this I feel makes sure the image source is always getting black in the picture to improve the contrast, any higher and you get black crush), sharpness is set to 40, color 50, Tint I think off the top of my head was 44/56 or somewhere around there. I noticed the set had some slight green hue, so I had to trim that and add some red. I used the TV's blue color filter with some CD calibration tool I downloaded here. For the picture I use Cool (sports) or Warm 1 (movies/TV). I have LED motion off, Cinema Off, Motion rate is set to Clear, HDMI level is LOW. I found that the HDMI level low gives me the best deep blacks especially at night. But I counter it with gamma +3 to bring out any dark shadows in the picture. Reason why is that When I look at cable content I notice that since the Cable HD source quality is lower than that of blue ray or video games the deeper grey/blacks sometimes get lost. The increase in gamma brings it out. However if that is not enough for the content I'm viewing I bring it back to Normal, But that's pretty rare...the content has to be a very low quality such as a poor video stream. The mpg stuff I leave on auto I like it since it makes the picture look better on downloaded movies I view with lower quality on such a big set. Blue Ray or Video game content looks phenomenal and feel like it has a nice color range with HDMI Black Low. I think that's it for my settings.  What has made an impact for me with this tv is  standard mode- backlight 16-18 (i change this based on what im watching) brightness 43-47 (same as above) dynamic contrast - high gamma- +3 digital clean view - high or auto MPEG noise filter- high or auto sharpness 30-40 Auto Motion Plus - clear Smart Led- Low  Once i switched to these, i got caught watching 300 Rise of An Empire on cinemax.. and stayed up way late.. and couldnt stop watching..  This is for Directv viewing only.. when i switch to another input or source youd have to change these again.. Is there a way to save settings for USB input and different hdmi inputs without changing these every time? I realize these settings go against all the others that have been posted here, but this seems to be a very subjective thing from person to person im seeing I dont see how anyone could use Movie mode.. it is so dull, lifeless, and dark..

The commercial units also cannot have their firmware updated and the warranty is only 90 days. I have no idea if there is any truth to this but thought I'd share.       If you believe that BS, I've got a nice bridge I'll sell you "

		"description": "   Firmly decided to buy the H8000. I want a well rounded TV with a quality image for low lag gaming, movies, and 3D. This TV seems to be the best overall option. Need to decide if I should buy the 55\" at 2 grand or the 65\" at 2.7 grand for that enhanced home theater experience. I have to buy at PC Richards as I have some credit there. As it is for my bedroom I would be fine with either size, but I don't want to have that need to upgrade feeling later on. However the 65\" one is slightly pricey for me and I might just settle for a 55\" with an XBOX One. I already have the PS4 but I am a fan of the respective systems exclusives like Halo and The Last of Us. Buying the 65\" would put off the XBOX One purchase til Next year for sure, and I will be late to the party with Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Tough choice for me. "

A great collection for someone like me who likes Halo, dabbled in it, but never played half of them or played them to death. And I am looking forward to watching Blu-Rays in style like Captain America 2 in 3D, playing The Last of Us Remastered on a quality display bigger than 23 inches is going to be awesome. "

So far I'm finding the best picture is with the Natural mode, which I don't see many people suggesting. Just my opinion though. You can get standard to look pretty good, too. But there was an earlier post about the best settings in Movie mode from consumer reports or something and I thought it was bleh.  I just got a Yamaha YAS-93 sound bar. It's fantastic. The built in speakers were surprisingly good on the TV but this is just so much better. Got it at Costco for $190 ($230+ on Amazon).  Only question I have is that the TV only gives two options: PCM or DTS Neo 2:5. I have no idea which one to choose. Both seem to sound similar. I'm not audiophile so just wondering what you guys are using and what your thoughts are. "

		"description": "   I will try to remember tonight, if nobody else has answered.  At any rate, I have had this TV since shortly after it was released, in the form of the UN65H8000. The first panel I got had horrible light bleed in the lower left &amp; upper right corners. As many know, any light, including bleed, really rides the curve of the screen, creating faux-clouding. At any rate, I returned it &amp; the guy on the phone said he had a refused delivery that he could sell with full waranty as \"New; Opened Box\", for 50% off. Well, that was over a year ago &amp; that TDxx panel is darn near perfect. I really enjoy it &amp; while the curve doesn't do much for me  when it comes to movies &amp; TV, it is awesome while grinding away time on my PS4.  I think I will keep it in the media room for another year or two &amp; then look at the 75+ SUHD models. BTW, anyone considering picking one of these up, keep an eye out for deals from Paul's TV &amp; Appliance. They are an online retailer (big provider for Amazon) &amp; they also have brick &amp; mortar locations in Southern California. I have found them very helpful, honest &amp; reliable in my past dealings, going back over a decade.  Any way, as I was saying, this TV gives you a cool perspective when playing FPS games &amp; the brightness &amp; color are amazing. The video settings are pretty robust, so you can really dial in color, black, contrast &amp; brightness setting to your individual preference. I see a lot of people talk about certain calibration settings, but each panel will respond from slightly to extremely different to each setting. For me, I just start at the factory settings &amp; then use what changes were made in the calibration details in the forum, adjusting &amp; readjusting till they look good to my eyes, which is all that really matters in the end.

I am pretty sure i screwed up white balance settings since right now every value in sub menu is 128 and i am pretty sure it was different before. Even if panels are not comparable i still want to see maybe a possible tweaking window.  I love this tv, hooked up all consoles and pc and its amazing in game mode. Only complaint is that one of the recent firmware updates screwed up brightness setting for game mode but it was tweakable and not such a big pain. Please take some photos of service menu if you can. But remember if you even just enter service menu without changing anything it will reset all your picture settings from normal user interface. "

It turns off then automatically turns right back on. It does this multiple times everyday and is not a factor of being on too long, as it has happened only 5 minutes after turning on or it may happen after 1 hour. The process takes about 30 seconds and doesn't require any work on my part but the tv is only 1 month old. The local Samsung official service could not resolve this issue. I have tried suggestions from the different internet forums and topics, including some settings in my Wi-Fi router, but it doesn't help. Does anyone have the same issue or know how to resolve it? "

Picture quality rated by most as better than anything out there. We are still using a 50\" 8 year old Panasonic plasma but it still looks good and only has 15,000 hours on it. Really hesitant to buy now but we're not so sure the Panny will make it until prices start falling on our preferred OLED TVs. A couple of grand for retired fixed incomes is a hard decision but we do love the big screens/great picture. "

I set up an exchange with Best Buy and then quickly canceled it after I saw these comments from another thread in here for a similar tv and then played around with them  My general settings where I get no flash lighting are Standard, brightness 34, backlight 3-7 (night time, nice and dark) but change it to 10-15 (daytime when blinds are open. I will notice flash lighting when I go 7+ on backlight or higher than 34 on the brightness), Contrast 90, Eco mode off, Dynamic Contrast LOW (This I feel pops the picture slightly without losing detail in the color gradients any higher I notice the grey bar deviate too much from the true picture), and Dark for the black level ( this I feel makes sure the image source is always getting black in the picture to improve the contrast, any higher and you get black crush), sharpness is set to 40, color 50, Tint I think off the top of my head was 44/56 or somewhere around there. I noticed the set had some slight green hue, so I had to trim that and add some red. I used the TV's blue color filter with some CD calibration tool I downloaded here. For the picture I use Cool (sports) or Warm 1 (movies/TV). I have LED motion off, Cinema Off, Motion rate is set to Clear, HDMI level is LOW. I found that the HDMI level low gives me the best deep blacks especially at night. But I counter it with gamma +3 to bring out any dark shadows in the picture. Reason why is that When I look at cable content I notice that since the Cable HD source quality is lower than that of blue ray or video games the deeper grey/blacks sometimes get lost. The increase in gamma brings it out. However if that is not enough for the content I'm viewing I bring it back to Normal, But that's pretty rare...the content has to be a very low quality such as a poor video stream. The mpg stuff I leave on auto I like it since it makes the picture look better on downloaded movies I view with lower quality on such a big set. Blue Ray or Video game content looks phenomenal and feel like it has a nice color range with HDMI Black Low. I think that's it for my settings.  What has made an impact for me with this tv is  standard mode- backlight 16-18 (i change this based on what im watching) brightness 43-47 (same as above) dynamic contrast - high gamma- +3 digital clean view - high or auto MPEG noise filter- high or auto sharpness 30-40 Auto Motion Plus - clear Smart Led- Low  Once i switched to these, i got caught watching 300 Rise of An Empire on cinemax.. and stayed up way late.. and couldnt stop watching..  This is for Directv viewing only.. when i switch to another input or source youd have to change these again.. Is there a way to save settings for USB input and different hdmi inputs without changing these every time? I realize these settings go against all the others that have been posted here, but this seems to be a very subjective thing from person to person im seeing I dont see how anyone could use Movie mode.. it is so dull, lifeless, and dark..       First off, let me say that this will be my last post on this God forsaken forum period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  truerogue With all of the futzing and tinkering you do I wonder if you will ever really be satisfied(I don't think so). Then you sit there and say \"I can see flashlighting with these settings but not with the other settings. The only reason you see flashlighting is because you are sitting there looking for it. You seem to be searching for the perfect picture. If there was a perfect TV, AVS Forum wouldn't exist because there would be nothing to complain about. Perhaps you should return the TV and listen to the radio, but you would probably find something to complain about whilst doing that.  As I've said before, I believe the Samsung H8000 series HDTV is one of the finest TV's on the market today. I sure am enjoying mine.

I like Bob and was a bit surprised at his response to you He is entitled to his own point of view.  Some do seek perfection, he and I are both more laid back in that area and do not look for imperfections but others are certainly free do so Hang in with us, you may help someone new to the H8000  All the best, "

Hi Neo,  I gave up watching TV about 14 years ago. Several years ago I decided to get a bluray player and watch movies on my 27\" 1080 computer monitor. Finally decided to go bigger and ended up getting the 55H8000. The viewing experience is completely different :-) If the H8000 has any flaws I don't notice them, I just enjoy the great, to me, picture  I'm not a gamer so I have no idea as to that side of things. Only thing connected to the set is my BP through a Denon AVR.  Stepping up from 23\" is huge! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do, and I believe many other owners of the set do also. "

As for how the H8000  compares to the M70, the H8000 will trounce the Vizio in color  reproduction and picture video processing but it can be argued that the  M70 has a more effective dimming scheme and it's a much better value.  I'm hopeful Vizio with their FALD televisions will shame Samsung towards  offering such televisions at affordable prices next year because  frankly I think Samsung can do them a lot better.

The Cinema Black feature does an amazing job at keeping blacks pitch black on letter bars even in a pitch black room. Im shocked, I figured only OLED could cure this issue (plasma aside).  The local dimming is pretty crazy here as well, credits, in a pitch black room with smart led enabled, I barely see any light blooming whatsoever around the lettering, unlike the Sonys, and black levels overall are phenomenal (tested Prometheus, scenes set in space, star fields looked phenomenal considering this is edge lit).  Also, something minor, but with speakers set to audio out, there is no popup whatsoever when using my Samsung smart remote to control my external speaker.  Other than that, motion is on point, couldnt be happier with it, gaming performance on gaming mode is excellent, no noticeable lag.  This TV has it all.       I'm curious, have you watched any 4:3 content with side bars and if so how uniform do they look (I'll be happy to hear from anyone on this)?  I don't see how Cinema Black would have any effect on side bars.  The M series has no uniformity issues whatsoever and both the top and bottom bars look great but its poor video processing is a deal killer for me.  It sounds like blooming is less noticeable on the H8000 but probably at the cost of effective contrast.  The F8500 suits my needs the best but it's base design will not work in my bedroom. "

Today I accidentally turned off my TV from the remote control and then immediately turn it on (after 4 to 5 sec). There was no picture on the screen, but sound was coming out from the speakers. I could switch the channel, but again no picture nothing on the screen. Then I turned it off again, waited for 1 minutes and turned on. The picture was back. Updated firmware to the latest version, but it didn't fix the issue.  It looks like software problem, but I didn't find any claims about the same issue on forums. Or maybe better to replace it? "

One TV mount with height adjust, tilt adjust so I  could move up or down, forward or back and tilt my TV as I needed. This  because when I play video games with my TV I seat near and when  watching movies I sit far and when watching music videos not to far not  to back...anyway.  There isn't a lot of options but I bought the  best one being that I could easily say this is the best commercial  available TV mount on the market: The Omni Mount Play 70.  I  installed with some professional help and words nor picture do justice  for how beautiful the TV looks. It looks like it is suspended in the  air. I can recommend this TV mount 100%.  I have attached some pictures. Please excuse the low quality of the iPhone pictures. "

I think the blacks are pretty good and there my be a bit of black crush at times but such events pass by and I really don't know how much if any details were lost. Honest officer, it was too dark to see anything.  I did, early on, reduce the backlight level to 10, IIRC, based on comments here...  I recall, either here, or one of the other threads I've been reading that for the fault finders once they search and find something then they can't \"unsee\" it (to paraphrase whatever they actually wrote). So I sit back and relax, watch, and enjoy the movie.  I hope some of the more expert folks can give you a better answer. "

		"description": "   Ok the auto switching my receiver to TV input is really starting to piss me off.  I switched off of the ARC HDMI input and hooked up the TV to the receiver with an optical cable thinking it was ARC triggering my receiver to switch inputs.   Even after doing this is STILL switches inputs when I turn the TV on.  The only way to get it to stop is to disable Anynet+ completely but that obviously kills all of the convenience of it as well.   Also when disabled there's no TV Speaker \"off\" option that I can find?  I just have to turn the volume all the way down?   Stupid.......  Anyone have any better luck with this than me?  On a weird side note when Anynet+ is on my receiver shows the input signal is Dolby Digital but when it's off its PCM?  I have my Xfinity box set to \"surround\"?

		"description": "   I've read this post from page 1 to the last one and I don't seem to recall much love for a HDTV! I watch movies with my projector but I use my HDTV (32\" Samsung 32F6300) on a daily basis to play video games (both with my PC and my PS4) and to watch movies when I don't want to use my home theater. Since I actually enjoy both activities (video games &amp; movie watching) I've been thinking about the possibility to upgrade my TV and went looking for the LG 55\" 4K OLED TV. The cons I read were enough to put me away for paying that much for a non \"perfect\" TV for my uses and then I read about the 55\" UN55H8000 HDTV.  I have some quick questions for the owners of this HDTV that I would be very grateful if you gave me your insight:  1. I've seen that many people here play video games with the 55H8000 and they talk about the immersive feeling the curved display gives. If I don't notice any lag whatsoever with my 32\" Samsung 32F6300 when playing video games to the point that I don't even use the GAME MODE, should I be fine with the 55H8000? (I play mostly games like GTA 5, Watch Dogs, COD and driving games like Grid 2). I plan to use the 55H8000 on the same room I have the 32\" and seat reasonably closer like 5.4 - 6 foot to play video games.  2. Being that my TV is said 32\" Samsung 32F6300 (that's the 6000 series) would I get a best picture quality with the 55H8000 when watching movies? By better I mean better colors rendition, better blacks and contrast and overall and improvement so I could notice the difference from my former TV?  3. For \"just\" about $300 more I could get the 55\" 4K Samsung HU8700 TV or even pay less for the 4K HU7250 TV. I know 4K it's supposed to be \"better\" BUT if ALL my content will be at 1080p because I don't forth see a lot of 4K content in both video games and movies in the next 2-3 years, if I were to play said 1080p content on any of those 4K TV would I get the same or better image of the H8000 TV? Is it true the 4K TVs produces more input lag than a 1080p? I read some place that a 4K TV actually UPSCALES the 1080p content to an almost 4K content so if that it's true the 4K TV would be a no brainer...  4. Last question: Amazon.com is selling the UN55H8000 at US$1997,99. Do you think this price could go lower at Black Friday? Being that this HDTV seems to be a very popular model I wouldn't like to wait until Black Friday to see if the price can go lower and then realize that not only did the price didn't went low but that the TV went into unavailability.  Thank you a lot for your help! Much appreciated!      "

I have bought 4 televisions from them and every one arrived in perfect condition. They use UPS freight for shipping.  Depending on where you live, shipping takes 2 to 3 days. Visit their site and call them. You can place your order over the phone which is the way I ordered mine. They are a first class operation and will answer any questions you might have. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.  "

I have some quick questions for the owners of this HDTV that I would be very grateful if you gave me your insight:  1. I've seen that many people here play video games with the 55H8000 and they talk about the immersive feeling the curved display gives. If I don't notice any lag whatsoever with my 32\" Samsung 32F6300 when playing video games to the point that I don't even use the GAME MODE, should I be fine with the 55H8000? (I play mostly games like GTA 5, Watch Dogs, COD and driving games like Grid 2). I plan to use the 55H8000 on the same room I have the 32\" and seat reasonably closer like 5.4 - 6 foot to play video games.  2. Being that my TV is said 32\" Samsung 32F6300 (that's the 6000 series) would I get a best picture quality with the 55H8000 when watching movies? By better I mean better colors rendition, better blacks and contrast and overall and improvement so I could notice the difference from my former TV?  3. For \"just\" about $300 more I could get the 55\" 4K Samsung HU8700 TV or even pay less for the 4K HU7250 TV. I know 4K it's supposed to be \"better\" BUT if ALL my content will be at 1080p because I don't forth see a lot of 4K content in both video games and movies in the next 2-3 years, if I were to play said 1080p content on any of those 4K TV would I get the same or better image of the H8000 TV? Is it true the 4K TVs produces more input lag than a 1080p? I read some place that a 4K TV actually UPSCALES the 1080p content to an almost 4K content so if that it's true the 4K TV would be a no brainer...  4. Last question: Amazon.com is selling the UN55H8000 at US$1997,99. Do you think this price could go lower at Black Friday? Being that this HDTV seems to be a very popular model I wouldn't like to wait until Black Friday to see if the price can go lower and then realize that not only did the price didn't went low but that the TV went into unavailability.  Thank you a lot for your help! Much appreciated!        Do yourself a big favor and buy the H8000 Samsung. You definitely will not regret it.  Also I think 4k tv is still a few years away from being a worthwhile purchase. "

		"description": "   Ok, I am almost reading to buy the UN55H8000 HDTV and I am way to excited! Just to quick questions: I read a review saying that even though the 55H8000 is a great TV, you could get the same results with the lower price Samsung H7150 even though I have make a specs comparison between those 2 models and the H8000 was Micro Dimming Ultimate and the H7150 has Micro Dimming Pro and the H8000 has CMR of 1200 and the H7150 of 960 and I like the curved model because I will use these TV (the H8000) only for myself for playing video games and watching some movies that my family don't like so I can be seated near and at the perfect center. So does buying the H8000 over the H7150 makes sense?  The second and last question is in comparison with the 55\" HU8700 &amp; HU8550 because I read a review saying that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal those 4K TVs is quite good and you can see every detail but on the other hand I have read other reviews and post saying that the upscaling a 4K TV does degrades or makes blurry the 1080p image and introduceds lag. The H8000 has the better ms response rate in gaming and said 4K models are worst but if it could be true that the UPSCALING of the 1080p signal actually creates a better looking image the H8000 would provide it could make some sense to buy the 4K model.  What do you think? Thank you!!! "

I remember just last year the thought of buying the top of the line Samsung Series (8000 Series) was just of a thought because of the high price and now we can buy at a reasonable price what seems to be one of the best 1080 HDTV ever.  Will post pictures! "

		"description": "   so here goes my experience:  purchased the 65\" coming up on 4 weeks ago from visions electronics here in surrrey, canada. ts01 panel type, sep 2014 manf date.  upon turning it on, the right side of the panel was perfect. the left side of the panel had minor clouding. however, approx 15 inches from the left was massive clouding all the way from top to bottom. picture a flashlight shining from the bottom up. telling you any dark scene was not watchable would be an understatement.  i got on the phone with samsung canada, who immediately booked a local area service company to contact me. the company called me and indicated they would order a \"new panel\" and that it would take 1-2 weeks to arrive.  the tech showed up today with a tv in a normal looking box, not new from what you get from the store. he did the normal speech that clouding is normal on all led tvs...now while i thought im getting a new tv, he took what he brought and opened all the screws and TOOK the panel out of it and proceeded to exchange it with mine. i stayed quiet thinking i would blow up at the end. but to my surprise, the new panel is 100x better. there is clouding on the edges but nothing that is overly distracting.  ill see how it goes over the next few days and report back if anything goes wrong....

I really would like to know how different blacks, colors, etc are between this and the 9000 and am wondering if its a situation like last years Sony where the W900 was just as good, if not better, than the 4K X900 except in resolution "

Several decades ago I started wearing progressive lenses in my glasses and I know some folks couldn't get comfortable with them... what I noticed was that they introduced a curve, similar to what I see on my H8000. Fortunately the progressive lenses didn't bother me and I'm fine with the curve on my Samsung but maybe some folks just won't feel comfortable with the curve. No right or wrong or which is best except for each individual, IMO. It does have processing that increases contrast(?) on objects determined to be closer to the viewer adding a sense of depth and this kinda pulls me into the picture. YVMV  I was looking at the 55H7150 at first and after seeing the 55H8000 I kept coming back to it so I finally decided to go with it, fortunately I'm quite happy with my choice. If its easy to return then that makes taking a chance a bit easier... I suspect either one would have been okay because I wouldn't be comparing them continually  I mostly just enjoy the picture and as someone else posted, don't recall if it was on this thread, once they found a problem they couldn't not see it. So if its not readily noticable I'll enjoy the picture. I did lower the backlight to around 10 which seemed better for me.  And while I have the 55H8000 I noticed with my latest prescription the magnification factor is such that I see an image roughly a foot wider... so I get a ~ a 65+\" view for the price of the 55\" model "

I enjoyed watching my brothers 47\" Samsung during visits but I knew if I bought one I wanted at least a 55\". I sit about 8' from the screen and wouldn't want it any smaller.  As with the review you mention from England, it seems most of us on the thread are happy with the 55H8000.  I doubt I qualify as an audiophile or videophile  As noted before I am enjoying the picture and the sound, especially with the added subwoofer but I am looking forward to getting the 4520CI powered up as the surround element is missing. Hope to start on running speaker wires in the next couple of days.  All the best, "

I already done a tv reset Someone found  the same problem? Or someone can try to use component input?  Thanks a lot       I do some other tests and this issue involves all the analog input: AV input and RGB input. So if some other owner can test this can confirm if this issue is not only for me Thanks "

		"description": "   Honestly you got lucky.  It's better that a good tech replace the panel than receive a whole new TV.   Almost all clouding and flashlighting is caused by overtightening of the screws that secure the panel.  This tech probably could have got your existing panel looking good by loosening and retightening the panel screws to the proper spec all the way around.  Sounds like he did a good job installing the new panel.  If you have any residual clouding you can probably massage it out with a microfiber cloth.  Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk "

At $1884, it's still over $700 cheaper than most other places. My viewing distance is 8' so initially I wanted a 55\" but the 65\" is actually cheaper right now. I'm worried about the picture quality at 8' away. Does anyone else sit relatively close to their 65\"?  BTW, it looks like Best Buys are getting rid of their display models so you might be able to pick up an open box one. I saw one for $2398. "

A question? If you weren't satisfied why didn't you just contact the place of purchase and request an exchange. If it were me, I would have demanded an exchange and not even messed around with a panel change. "

I doubt I qualify as an audiophile or videophile  As noted before I am enjoying the picture and the sound, especially with the added subwoofer but I am looking forward to getting the 4520CI powered up as the surround element is missing. Hope to start on running speaker wires in the next couple of days.  All the best,       Hi Ken The biggest tv I've ever had is 46\". I bought a 55\" Sony x850b but it was returned due to panel problems. The day I returned it I set up the 46\" and immediately noticed the difference between 46\" and 55\". The 55\" was much easier on my 68 year old eyes.  I'm going to get the un55h8000 and the 46\" Sony will be relegated to bedroom duties.  BTW, I too am retired. "

While I like the added pixel and what the future may hold for 4k I can't help but feel the H8000 is the way to go since 90% percent of usage will be PS4 gaming. I love the curve and the price for the 55\" of both models fall well in line with one another, so make the leap or stick with flagship 1080p. Oh and having the NX720,man that is a beautiful display and I wish mine hadn't died on me. "

Particularly that they put the stock sharp level up to 20.....  I get such a clean picture with it set at 0, I feel like they really cranked it for no reason.  Anyhow, I'm on my phone and not able to go through all of the pages easily.  Does anyone have calibration settings for this set?  Using some F8000 settings that look pretty good but would love some settings for the curved panel.  Thanks! "

		"description": "     My son plays with a PS3 and a PS4;  he says that there is a noticeable difference when using game mode. Maybe as much as a 1/2 second difference.  Just his thoughts, not measured at all. The PS4 must be turned on to be recognized before game mode can be selected. The PS4 is in HDMI 2.  We received the 48 inch version of the TV yesterday. So too early for a considered evaluation.  But, initial thoughts are very positive. I have scoured this forum for a couple of weeks. I had never heard of all the things that can go wrong with an LED screen. Clouding, flashlighting,  light bleed, banding, oh my!!!!  From what I have seen so far and after looking for it with a black screen at night and dark scenes at night, I have panel TS01 and I have not seen any such issues yet.  I went from my CRT Sony Trinitron Wega 1080i 36 inch. I loved that tv. But, after 8 years it died.  I planned to get a Sony as I have only had a Sony for over thirty years. My husband is still watching and enjoying a 2003 Sony XBR LCD!  But, after much research reading reviews and this forum, I decided on this Samsung H8000.    It made the list of 10 best televisions in the world as did a couple of Sony televisions.  Right out of the box, the picture is crisp, no motion issues,  colors are great, skin tones look natural, and the black levels are very dark with no light bleed at all. Right out of the box in standard picture mode, it is almost perfect for me. We tweaked the settings very slightly in standard mode.  I put sound on clear voice mode.  The only trouble I am having at all is voice recognition when trying to use voice interaction.  I was actually sad to not get a Sony, seriously almost 1/2 my life with a Sony tv!!!  But, this tv is amazing to me and is far superior in picture quality to my 2006 CRT. And, to the 2003 Sony XBR, granted that Sony is an older tv. "

Nearly all of you who own either the 55\" or the 65\" are reporting great uniformity, very little clouding/flashlighting and very good black levels. It doesn't seem to matter which panel(tdxx/tsxx) you have as both seem to be pretty good.  There has been some complaints pertaining to input lag, but I'm assuming it has to do with gaming. I'm not a gamer so that wouldn't bother me. I don't care about 3d either.  The only Samsung tv I've had was the UN46B8500 full array local dimming. Alas that tv developed a panel problem(vertical multi-colored lines on half of the panel). I had it repaired under warranty but it was never the same . That was in 2011 and I've stayed away from Samsung since  The only other brand I've owned is Sony(kdl46nx720 still going strong). I recently bought an xbr55x850b 4k Sony in early July and returned it after a week because of horrible clouding/flashlighting. A replacement was sent and two weeks later it was also returned for the same issues(refund).  I would like to say that because of all of the positive responses concerning the H8000 I strongly believe that i'm going to give Samsung another shot. My preferred place of purchase is Crutchfield.

As stated by others, bright scenes look great however as soon as a dark scene (The Last of Us) is displayed, auto dimming goes crazy and makes it hard to see anything.  My old set, I was able to adjust the white balance by lowering it and turning up the brightness setting, thus passing the auto dimming threshold and tricking the set into thinking the brightness did not require auto dimming.  Has anyone figure out how to trick this model yet?  Cheers. "

Oh well.       The $4k was for the LG OLED that's 55''.  I read some recent news about burn-in though.  I'm not in the mood to spend that much and then baby it.  Are you referring to auto dimming or local?  Auto dimming will dim the entire picture on darker scenes to give the effect of deeper blacks.  There's usually no setting to change if your TV is equipped with it.  Local Dimming dims just the darker sections, or zones, of the picture, leaving the rest of the scene alone.  It's usually referred to as Smart LED on Samsung Sets and there's a high/low setting.   Anyone with a 65\" H8000 have a TS01 Panel or are they only TD01 Panels?  Do the H8000 Owners with clouding/uniformity problems have U.S. Versions with Local Dimming activated or is it just bad luck? "

Only issue I have is that my surround sound receiver doesn't pass 1080p or 3D thru the hdmi so I have the picture going direct from the sources to the TV thru hdmi and the audio going to my receiver with optical.  The issue I have now is the fluctuation of audio from my Comcast STB when I go to a HD channel with Dolby Digital sound.  Center channel seems to fluctuate.  May have to get a new Pioneer receiver.  TV though is great.  Had it since July 17th and only thing I've done is put it in Movie mode and turn off the soap opera affect. "

		"description": "   Okay, just got my new UN65H800! Quite happy with it so far, but noticeable black uniformity issues unless Smart LED is turned on.  I run my blu ray player and my PC through my Denon receiver, through HDMI to the TV. When I name this source \"PC\" then switch sources on the receiver from actual PC to blu ray, the TV somehow knows these inputs are different and will save different picture settings for each. This is nice, and would be perfect if PC mode allowed Smart LED to be activated. I use my PC for games, and the flashlighting turns up more in games than it does in movies it seems (loading screens, etc.).  Otherwise, if I name that source on the TV \"game\" or \"AV Receiver\", whatever picture settings I set are global for that TV source, regardless if I change the Denon's source. This is annoying since I'd want to use something like game mode, and different sharpness settings for when the Denon's source is my PC vs movie settings for when the Denon's source is my blu ray.  Any ideas? "

Stop beating your head against the wall and buy the H8000. You won't regret it and you'll probably sleep better at night       Sounds like solid advice.

There's not a wide variety of panels with the h8000.  65\" has TD01/02 and 55\"/ 46\" have TS01/02.  I've been looking at the 65\" for a while now but keep hearing about slight uniformity issues.  I'm seriously considering the LG55EC9300 OLED that recently came out but really scared of Burn-in/Image Retention. "

		"description": "   My 55H8000 arrived today, panel version TS02. I have not noticed any flashlighting/clouding at all. The picture is superb and I haven't even touched the settings yet. The sound is actually quite good although it will benefit greatly from a soundbar/subwoofer system. Standard definition programming through dish network is the best I've ever seen. High definition is out of this world as is blu-ray.  Regarding the curved screen, it took me all of two minutes getting used to it. The curve is very subtle and does provide slightly better off angle viewing. The curvature of the stand is greater than that of the tv itself so it's my thinking that it makes getting used to the curved screen easier.  I'll tinker with the settings over the next few days, but right now I'm going to sit back and enjoy this wonderful tv.  To say I'm happy would be an understatement Well done Samsung. "

Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk       Did the Flashlighting go away at all with Local Dimming on High?  The LG OLED, (9300), just got a firmware update that supposedly fixed the motion issues.  But, the issues were mainly with owners not activating the Tru-Motion, or whatever LG calls their motion settings, while watching blu rays with a 24/1080p film cadence.  Once turned on, there were no issues but obviously introduced Soap Opera Effect.  New update fixed it. "

I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don't have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000's must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask!       Just the post I was looking for.  I'm looking to upgrade from my LN52A860 (the set that made me fall in love with Samsungs)  but I've been torn after looking at articles on the top gaming TVs.  I really don't want to go back to a Sony. I have no idea what the input lag is on my LN52A860 but I was hoping to improve on it. There is no game mode on the LN52A860 (that I know of). It looks like the only real option from 2014 Samsung models is the H800s. I'm torn between the 55\" or 65\" but my main concern is if the 34-37ms lag is still going to be noticeable. I couldn't find any info on how the LN52A860 rated with input lag so I don't really have any comparison. My other question is how does turning on game mode effect the picture quality? "

		"description": "   I got mine about 7 days ago.  Its the US version.  Its a TD02.   I like the TV, but then I also don't like it.  I was VERY leary about getting a SAMSUNG..I have Panasonic Plasma (that I love) &amp; an older Mitshubishi LCD.  I LOVE the 3D on this.  I LOVE the SMARTness and the apps.   I think the picture is good, but Damn it needs a real tune (mine is in the basement and its darker down there...LOL).  I do have setting that I can live with.   I have tried many tunes.  I have tried some in this thread.  I think its best to use the \"auto\" setting for the 10-point.  Bottom line for me is that my AVR equipment is not playing friendly with it (that bugs the living crap out of me).   Samsung must HATE Pioneer or vice-versa.  To me it's a travesty that this TV wants to force the use of an optical connection to my SC-72 (SC-72 is a 2013 receiver and an awesome one at that).  I have switched the receiver to allow ARC...I have played with the DVI HDMI input and other video conversion settings on my receiver and this TV just will not support true HDMI discovery/ARC with my Pioneer.  I will NOT use an Optical cable to make it happy.  Instead I have to move the input manually to get them all to \"play nice in the sand box\".   My Panasonic sure had no issues with Pioneer!!!   I am on the fence about taking this back...I like the TV.  My Pioneer BDP-62FD Blu-Ray gets detected by the TV and will auto switch to the proper input, but its slow and you see the stupid on-screen msg about the source not present (that's crap and SLOW!).  Also when watching a BD the 16:9 black bars sometimes go in and out between \"full screen\" while playing the same movie.  I want \"full\" not black bars.  Cant seem to get that sorted even with the SmartBD option turned off.   Basically, I will be calling Pioneer, but I think it's the TV.  If I have to hook up an optical just to get the units to talk outside of pure HDMI then I say \"F\" this TV!!!  I surely value my Pioneer elite AVR better than the TV!   I have all HDMI 2.0 high end cables.   BTW: If you want to reset this TV back to \"out of box settings\" then you need the PIN number.  I called Samsung last night.  the PIN is 0000 (4 zeros).   If I can get the thing to like Pioneer then I am keeping it...it is a nice picture when It wants to be.  I still want real tune settings for a dark room however,   Sorry for the long read, but please someone \"help\" me with the Pioneer stuff and I will love this TV.   I also have a PS4 and it works with Game mode on or off, but Game mode seems better. "

		"description": "   I am guessing (hoping) Pioneer can help.  If I try to use true ARC and hook Verizon, PS4, and BD to TV, then take TV to SC-72 I would only get Dolby 5.1 from Apps and get 2.0 from PCM(also would require optical as well) instead of full 7.1 HD sound with one HDMI.  I realize I can switch receiver to an input and get both via an HDMI, but TV wont allow it automatically without conversion that will create input-lag that will make video and audio suffer for different things(IE: video lag to great for games &amp; Audio would not be HD to allow for proper streamed video).  I also still have no idea how to make the Input on this H8000 be PC???  Does anyone know if I can use the Receiver's 2 separate HDMI \"outputs\" go to TV instead of TV to AVR \"Inputs\"?  That way I would have audio and video HDMI split?  I am not a pro here by any means. "

I don't know why it took me so long but today I hit the picture reset button and it fixed it, no flashing in the black bars, background walls are a solid color it's working like it did when it was new.

I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy. "

The 7150 base would have been too wide for my stand which would have required the purchase of a new stand. The 8000 fit on the one I already had which allowed me to put that money into the TV instead of having to buy a new stand or pay to have it mounted (That's the way I rationalized it out anyway). "

		"description": "   Hi All,  I've only ever had Sony's and most recently bought a 65\" X9 4k. The set is amazing in every regard EXCEPT motion resolution. It's ok for tv and films but awful for video games. I suspect this is a combination of high lcd latency and upscaling. Game mode has low input lag but the motion blur is terrible when playing FPS'. I play with interpolation turned on and it helps a good bit but it's still pretty bad, especially on 30fps games, and lag is way up.  So, I'm selling the TV, which is heartbreaking. I use my tv primarily for games and can't deal with the blur. My sony from 2010 was much better in terms of motion but the picture was obviously not nearly as good. I'm seriously considering the Samsung h8000 because my understanding is that Samsung's in general have better motion handling and this particular set is best.  My question is for gamers. What is the motion blur like in game mode and have you played with AMP on? Is it better with a tolerable latency? I don't play competitively so even 100ms doesn't bother me. But motion blur kills the experience. Many gamers said they thought the x9 was great for gaming, but clearly they're not sensitive to blur. I'd love to get some candid responses regarding motion blur and gaming on this set. Thanks!  Jason "

		"description": "   I just read this in the H8000 users manual. Is this something I would really have to worry about?  Still image warning Constantly displaying still pictures can cause image burn-in on the LED screen. Follow the recommendations below: Avoid displaying the same tv channel for long periods. Always try to display any image in full screen. Reduce the brightness and contrast to avoid the appearance of after-images.  Preventing burn-in Avoid keeping a still picture or a picture with static elements(black bars, black borders, logos etc)on your tv for more than two hours at a time. If that's unavoidable, change the picture or change to another channel for a minute or two every couple of hours. Reducing the brightness and contrast of the when it's displaying static elements will also help.  Nowadays  almost every channel has their logo on the screen and most channels have the black letterbox bars. Channels like ESPN(sports ticker)CNN(news ticker &amp; stocks etc)are always displaying.  I'm hoping someone can reassure me that this is not really a problem, I want a tv that I can enjoy watching, not a tv that I constantly have to babysit. I thought image retention and burn-in only happened on plasma tv's. I got rid of a Panasonic plasma for the same reasons listed above. I've had my Sony KDL-46NX720 for 3 years and never noticed any image retention or burn-in at all.  I haven't ordered yet, but if this is going to be a problem then I'll have to pass.  I'm hoping someone can help.  Thanks much. "

After reading most of the H7150 posts it seems it's hit or miss with uniformity problems.  Even among Samsung Panels, (TS01/TH01).  I think a lot of the 7150 owners who claim their set is relatively blemish free are not sure what uniformity is or aren't obsessing over it because there are quite a few reports of Flashlighting and clouding on the S-PVA Panels.       I own both.  I love the 7150.  I think all of the sets are going to have some screen uniformity issues etc but overall it is a great tv.  Way much better than last years 7100 series. No comparison. That being said, I think the 8000 curve blows the 7150 away. The smart tv / web browser is much snappier as well as better screen uniformity, flash lighting and black levels.  So much so that I am planning on selling mine and picking up another one if I can get a good deal.  Both are winners in my book but if you have the extra money, the 8000 would be the way to go. The curve is just sexy.       How is the Flashlighting on the 8000 in a dark room? "

After reading lots of posts here I did go in thinking I'd probably buy the 55H7150 but watching both for a while pushed me to the 8000 even at an additional $400.  When I told the sales rep at Best Buy that I wanted a Samsung panel he had no idea that some sets didn't use Samsung panels, nor did the guy that delivered and set it up. Happily it came with a TS02.  I've been without a TV for 14 years and finally recycled the massive, 225 pound Sony monitor, and old electronics to make way for a new setup. I only watch DVDs and Blu-Ray movies on it. Love the picture. I did turn the backlight down to 10.  I think the sound on the set is pretty good for a TV but it is weak in the low end, no shaking the walls. I remembered that my BD player has audio out jacks and one of them is a sub-woofer output so i plugged in my Velodyne sub-woofer built in 1991. Much nicer. I had to put a new foam surround on it as it self destructed on my first movie, Ender's Game. The foam was rotted. Found a repair kit at a company in Southern California. Cost $40 with tax and postage. Sounds great.  Looking to get a Marantz NR1605 for the time being, as the budget is a bit tight after the cost of the TV ;-) "

Hopefully, I made a wise choice. The Bu-ray arrives later in the week.   You should be good with that blu-ray player. Right now I have the Panasonic DMP-BDT500, but might need to replace it soon as I'm starting to get strange artifacts on the right side of my screen on certain movies. Thought at first it was the movies, but tried a friends player and didn't get it. Let me know how you like the Sammy blu-ray player. Might look into that one myself. Let me know how well it handels 3D as well, as that is something I do like and one of the reasons I went with the bd-t500.       Hi Joseph,  This is a late reply but I just recently signed on with AVS Forums.  I watched Prometheus in 3D on my BD-F7500 and thought it did pretty well. The glasses bother some folks eyes or cause headaches but I did alright. I remember 3D movies in the 1950s and never had a problem with them either.  I also tried the 2D &gt; 3D option and it added a bit of depth but not as much as a 3D disk.  The glasses are a bit like sunglasses and make the picture darker which I  don't care for. "

The Bad: It doesn't have as deep a black level as a plasma; it suffers from a slight red push; it has a reflective screen; Yahoo apps aren't very slick; and the remote sensor isn't very responsive. The Bottom Line: The Vizio M-Series offers a potent combination of excellent design, decent picture quality, and a pocket-friendly price.'  You get what you pay for.  If your satisfied with a little less picture quality and apps, a little lower quality of the passive 3D image, a picture that doesn't pop like it's cheaper E-Series TV, then you are welcome to buy a lower quality set.  Good picture, but not better than a Samsung. "

I am amped for the P-series Vizio right now, but share the same concerns with Vizio use of the term full array. I have owned the HX929 from Sony and that was a hell of a set. While H8000 is an edge based dimmer, samsung has a rather impressive implementation. I am optimistic for the P-series, but will likely end up with the H8000 @ 1080p or the HU7250 (curved) or HU8550 (flat)@ 4k. "

This issue is very regular, so i suspect a firmware bug (the last 1141 is already instelled), but i'm not very sure and could be my tv set defective also.

Still image warning Constantly displaying still pictures can cause image burn-in on the LED screen. Follow the recommendations below: Avoid displaying the same tv channel for long periods. Always try to display any image in full screen. Reduce the brightness and contrast to avoid the appearance of after-images.  Preventing burn-in Avoid keeping a still picture or a picture with static elements(black bars, black borders, logos etc)on your tv for more than two hours at a time. If that's unavoidable, change the picture or change to another channel for a minute or two every couple of hours. Reducing the brightness and contrast of the when it's displaying static elements will also help.  Nowadays  almost every channel has their logo on the screen and most channels have the black letterbox bars. Channels like ESPN(sports ticker)CNN(news ticker &amp; stocks etc)are always displaying.  I'm hoping someone can reassure me that this is not really a problem, I want a tv that I can enjoy watching, not a tv that I constantly have to babysit. I thought image retention and burn-in only happened on plasma tv's. I got rid of a Panasonic plasma for the same reasons listed above. I've had my Sony KDL-46NX720 for 3 years and never noticed any image retention or burn-in at all.  I haven't ordered yet, but if this is going to be a problem then I'll have to pass.  I'm hoping someone can help.  Thanks much.       While it's technically possible to burn in a LCD panel, it's not going to happen. That language is there purely for legal purposes. Burn in just isn't going to happen. Ever. One of the reasons plasmas are going off of the market is due to the burn in resistance of LCDs. And there is nothing different about the Samsung panel that makes it more susceptible.  Trust me, don't think twice about it. I've had lcd monitors playing the same content on loops for years on end without issue (demo material). And if it were an issue, there would be no tv on the market that anyone could buy.  It's entirely possible that language is just a hold over from the manual the company did for their plasma and no-one thought to take it out. "

My UN46D7000 completely gave out and after a lengthy warranty process with Samsung (initiated back in February) they will be delivering the unit shortly. I had the option between this model and the H7150, and chose the larger 48\" curved over the older flat display. Does anyone have any advice upon receipt of the unit? I plan on using my existing wall mount, is that ill-advised? "

All these TVs have a \"game mode\" to combat the issue. If you're able test them both, see which one you feel better with. "

I returned them and waited for the H8000, but then actually decided to go for the HU9000.

		"description": "   Good day everyone,  I purchased the 65H8000 this past weekend mainly for games. I was worried about the input lag. I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don't have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000's must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask! "

You can't set it at any level, it's automatically on and there is NO level to control.  Subsequently, the US version has no option to control it either ( at least not in the entire manual )  So for all the Canadian customers, no one was left out, we do have it and on ALL screen sizes.  for the UK people, I would call to confirm if it's available.  I have the 65\" and I haven't had any issues with the black levels.  I am going to get it calibrated probably within the month, depending on the availability of the calibrator. "

		"description": "   Hello. Did everyone leave? This thread has been quiet for a few days. Usually this is about the time people begin finding issues with their new toys and start complaining. But, apparently this television is different than the usual, and people are enjoying the new purchase. If this is true then this TV is worth the steep price tag. How difficult is it to place the stand assembly onto the set out of the box? I'm guessing that with the curved screen, extra care must be taken when laying it down to prevent damage. Or do you simply set the television down onto the stand upright, like the way Panny plasmas are stand mounted? Thanks guys congrats on your new sets. I have a Mits DLP that is starting to show signs of chip failure (specks/spots visible during dark scenes or when screen is blank/no input) so the 65 is looking like a prime replacement. Of course it's cheaper to fix, but 10,000:1 contrast ratio is a little passe these days. "

Samsung seems to get \"Movie Mode\" really well. I'm not going to say it's set to D6500K, but its damn good. :) When I set it to movie mode I didn't have to play with much... Turned down the backlight, contrast, brightness. Turned off all the picture \"enhancements\" (dynamic contrast, Black tone...) I do use Smart LED , and Cinema Black (just helps to keep black bars \"black\" if a movie has it) But yeah... Very solid picture!\u00a0  "

It's there on my Blu ray player, bell dish, etc. etc. I've tried different cables and did the factory reset. I  unplugged the unit for an hour. I'm out of options. The only way to make it less noticeable is to lower the contrast and backlight settings so low that it ruins the picture. I tried the cloth deal from above, it didn't help. I'll be calling Samsung Monday Morning. Outside of the clouding issue I really enjoyed the set. Set up was a breeze. That little smart remote which I'd thought I would hate is so easy to use. I love it. Picture for movies and sports was tremendous. Broadcast TV like fox and nbc with their 1 hour dramas were not nearly as good as film and sport. I'm going to put in moon goo's settings now and see what they are like. The TV is a breeze to assemble. Like pointed out earlier, stand is very flimsy. I make sure to hold on to set when plugging and pulling out cables. I paid 2900 Canadian cash for the set in Toronto before tax and warranty. That's it, that's all I got. What are the odds on this?

You should be good with that blu-ray player. Right now I have the Panasonic DMP-BDT500, but might need to replace it soon as I'm starting to get strange artifacts on the right side of my screen on certain movies. Thought at first it was the movies, but tried a friends player and didn't get it. Let me know how you like the Sammy blu-ray player. Might look into that one myself. Let me know how well it handels 3D as well, as that is something I do like and one of the reasons I went with the bd-t500. "

But I am sure that the Samsung website said local dimming for the H8000 and the 4k model above it (just checked). As far as the F8000.. the reviews I read stated pretty significant uniformity issues without engaging the local dimming (but excellent uniformity after that was engaged). For those that had no issues even with it turned off I guess it may have been luck of the draw. I know I was pretty unlucky with my first 60in 7100 and 2 Sony 850As. But, my 55in 7100 currently looks awesome, prob put that in the bedroom and place whatever 65in I decide on in the living room.. if the H8000 in the US show similarly negative reviews id lean towards the F8000.  \u00a0 So we're on the same page: Smart LED feature == \"Precision Black\" == local dimming Micro Dimming Ultimate == software-based video processing. It's not really local dimming of the LEDs at all. \u00a0 The US versions\u00a0of the\u00a0F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate as well as\u00a0Precision Black local dimming. The UK and\u00a0Canadian versions of the F8000 and H8000 have Micro Dimming Ultimate, but NOT Precision Black local dimming. \u00a0 The UK version of the H8000 that was reviewed has no hardware-based local dimming. It's an actual difference in the hardware, not just software. To make things more confusing, the Canadian H8000 webpage says \"Precision Black (Local Dimming) Available\". So there's probably two different versions of the TV in Canada. \u00a0 That\u00a0AVForums H8000 review\u00a0is a bit confusing: \"The also H8000 doesn't include Samsung's Smart LED feature which is a shame because it really helps with the perceived blacks but its absence is consistent with last year's F8000 model. However the local dimming was very effective, expertly handling our usual assortment of torture tests.\"\u00a0They seem\u00a0to imply that the UK H8000 they tested has local dimming, which it doesn't. I'm guessing they were actually referring to F8000 and the fact that its local dimming is effective. \u00a0 FWIW, my Canadian UN55F8000, which has no local dimming, has no issues with uniformity.  "

		"description": "   Regarding your question about gaming mode on the H8000. The review on avforums indicated:\u201cThe H8000 delivered a sizeable input lag of 120ms when in the calibrated Movie mode but thankfully things improved dramatically when the Game mode was selected. This brought the input lag down to 34ms which whilst not the lowest we've measured - Sony appear to be the leaders in this area at the moment - should be low enough for all but the most demanding of gamers. Unlike the HU8500, renaming the input didn't make any difference to the lag but 34ms is amongst the best we have measured recently. Certainly we didn't notice any appreciable delay when gaming on the H8000 and overall we found it to be quite responsive, although our reactions might not be as cat-like as many others. If you sat quite close to the display, the curved nature of the screen could also help to make the gaming experience slightly more immersive\u201d. This review indicated the input lag in Gaming mode is identical to that specified in the avforums review:\"Samsung has reduced the input lag on the 55H8000 compared with last year\u2019s 55F8000, though it\u2019s still behind the class-leading Sony Bravias. Our Leo Bodnar input lag tester returned a figure of 34ms in [Game] mode; and a much less gaming-friendly 119ms in [Movie] mode.\" This review recorded an input lag lower than 34ms:\"After the rather disappointing 60ms-plus input lag reading recorded on the UE65HU8500, it\u2019s great to see the UE55H8000 only hitting a much more gaming-friendly figure of 33ms.\"  The User Manual on the Canadian web site indicates that the television does indeed have a gaming mode. Further, the topic titled \u201cEnabling Game Mode\u201d provides instructions for accessing this feature. For your reference, here is the sequence: MENU &gt;System &gt; General &gt; Game Mode Try Now. There are a few warnings about Game Mode in the User Manual:Game Mode cannot be used for normal TV viewing. Connect the gaming console before enabling Game Mode. Otherwise, the picture quality may suffer. The screen may shake a little. Enabling Game Mode automatically sets the Picture Mode to Standard and the Sound Mode to Movie. To use a different external device, first disconnect the game console and disable Game Mode.  Hope this helps. Looking forward to more reviews. My 55H8000 arrives today. "

Thanks for the response. \u00a0I looked up the H7150 thread and most people seem to have problems with the 75\" tv. \u00a0Is this your takeaway as well, or did I miss some posts? \u00a0Does anyone else with the H8000 want to Chime in. \u00a0I'm wondering about viewing angles. \u00a0I live in a city rowhome/townhouse (which means a narrow house). The couch is probably about 6-8 feet away from the tv. \u00a0While I'm sure it'll look great for the person right in front of the tv, what about 2,3, or 4 other people that might be watching the tv as well?

The 55F8000 has best in class color and contrast that create superior images and the light flow through the the LED backlights is amazing. Images on screen are crisp, and refined compared to some of the other LED TVs out there. The backlight does need to be kept in check because it has the potential to wash colors and contrast out. The safe zone for the backlight setting on this TV is around 70% of capacity.  "

To quote this article, Game mode \"...isn't magic, nor does it simply overclock the processors and jack up the performance. Instead, it starts taking things out. Color processing, noise reduction, advanced scaling, all of these aspects and more get thrown out or greatly reduced\". So, the Game mode on the H8000 follows the industry standard to reduce input lag. There are a number of good articles available. Just Google Game Mode. "

The screen was very well protected and the all of the accessories were provided in a separate box. A cleaning cloth was provided, which I thought was a nice touch. The chrome accent strip around the screen and the stand were well protected with plastic film. I recently set up a new Sony television, and the Samsung experience provided a greater sense that someone was paying attention to the details. I have not had time to test the settings provided in a previous post, but picture quality in Movie mode is amazing. I played Master and Commander (an old favorite) tonight and it was stunning. SD video looks very good and Netflix movies look equally good. My only (minor) criticism is that the stand seems a little flimsy. Also, the screen seems prone to reflection from our floor lamps. Small issues. Overall, I would give this television an 8.5 or a 9 out of 10 for picture quality, construction, ease of operation, and features. Most of the reviews I have read to date seem to concur with this assessment. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from other owners. "

Will try this TV for 1 more week, if it continues to have problems then it is going back to store Samsung customer service could not tell me if this TV hasBluetooth LE (4.0) CPU Speed (quad core plus means what?) Total Ram (not flash storage)  It currently says 349.8 MB used out of 1.22 GB If anyone knows these specifications, kindly reply.EDIT: Jun 4, 2014 Netflix problem was resolved after talking to netflix support. BTW if you want to go into service menu, the code is Press Mute followed by 1, 8, 2, PWR, the TV will shutdown and restart with Service menu overlay. Be EXTREMELY careful playing around with service menu, there are several posts on AVS forum where people have bricked their sets after changing values. - Have successfully paired Logitech Bluetooth keyboard however most of the apps do not support keyboard for text entry. - This TV does NOT allow Bluetooth audio playback. (Actually none of the smart TV sets support it, this was confirmed by Samsung customer service) Samsung recommends connecting wireless headsets to Audio out port. I am fairly happy with the set after fixing Netflix glitch. The disappointments are (not necessarily with Samsung): 1. Lack of Bluetooth audio I cannot understand why samsung could not put an audio driver for the BT chipset, they support keyboard, mouse, smart remote via bluetooth so why not AUDIO!! IMHO it was a very stupid decision by TV department to exclude BT Audio. 2. APPS a) Apps do not have consistent data entry i.e. very few apps support smart remote, for others you have to use regular remote. It is very frustrating to juggle between two remotes, netflix supports smart remote but almost every other app I have tried requires the use of regular remote with Red, Blue, Green and Yellow keys. b) Keyboard panel in apps for text entry is not consistent E.G. Netflix - The Login Id/Passwd uses regular QWERTY mode but for searching it switches to ABCD mode! This is a samsung issue though because their SDK should NOT expect app developers to fiddle with keyboard layout. c) The weather channel: If you can setup multiple locations without cursing the app then you have far more patience than me d) TV/Movies Section It would tell you if a show is available on Vudu or Hulu to rent/buy but will not show if it is available on netflix or Amazon. How can it not connect to netflix or amazon using their API to search? e) Removing Apps If anyone finds out how to remove pre-installed apps then please let me know e.g. M2Go Samsung App panel developers, please get your act together!! Don't get me wrong, I am fairly happy with the \"TV\" but when I am buying a Smart TV, I expected a bit more polished experience. Feel free to ask any other questions. "

More than twice as fast as a Quad Core processor, it delivers smoother and faster navigation and multitasking for web browsing, switching between content and more.   \u00a0 It sounds like it is a faster clock speed on the CPU. \u00a0 \u00a0 I haven't heard anything about bluetooth in my research. \u00a0I also haven't found anything related to how much RAM   "

After about 2 minutes we both agreed - that's the one! \u00a0 Long story short - I was ready to buy the 50\"\u00a0but my wife said no -\u00a0let's go for the 65\" ... and\u00a0for a lot\u00a0less money than\u00a0the 4K Curved. \u00a0 So, we're picking it up tomorrow morning ... Product Code: UN65H8000AF. \u00a0 I'll report back later with my impressions when I get it home and tweak it up.   So... How is the new tv?  "

		"description": "   Sorry Everyone for not getting back sooner ... It's been overwhelming getting this unit set up and we love this TV so much now we can't stop watching / fiddling with it. \u00a0 It needs a minimal amount of tinkering out of the box - that's nothing new ...\u00a0After changing to 'Movie' mode, that was really all it took to get a decent picture that I watched all afternoon. \u00a0 Yea, we spent the whole entire afternoon watching French Open Tennis - Sorry! \u00a0 Then yesterday we had to go back to Best Buy (Canada) and buy a TV stand to go with it ... (Whalen BBCXL54-NV - Reg: $269.00 / Paid: $199.00) ... So, we spent the 2nd day putting that together and watching more TV (I'm an old retired guy so I need to take breaks)\u00a0 \u00a0 I did notice some motion judder / stuttering in the fast tennis action but it wasn't overly bad ... Just the same, I went to &lt;Auto Motion Plus&gt; under Picture --&gt; Options and changed the setting to &lt;Standard&gt; - I saw no more stuttering after that.\u00a0 \u00a0 Also, at first - the 65\" was kind of overwhelming even at 10 feet away ... coming from a 50\" Panasonic Viera plasma - Not a shabby TV either. In any case now with a viewing distance of 12' - I love it and don't think we'll ever go to the movie theater again. \u00a0 \u00a0 Just some facts and observations now ... \u00a0 Model: UN65H8000AFXZC / Panel: TS01 No dead / stuck pixels \u00a0 Best Buy: List Price - $3799.99 and includes a Samsung Galaxy TABPRO 10.1\" Tablet (worth $520.00) ... {FYI - This is expensive and was an ok deal ONLY because I wanted the TABPRO 10.1\" - 2560x1600} \u00a0 Measured Power: 2 Watts in STANDBY ... 145 Watts while ON ... Measured using the BluePlanet EM100 Energy Meter {FYI - The old Viera plasma ran between 480 - 550 Watts ... No kidding} \u00a0 Picture wise: It looks fabulous! ... However, I did notice some small back light bleed around the edge and some uneven lighting when viewing a black screen but take that with a grain of salt since I don't (yet) have a calibration disc so I can't be really sure of what I'm looking at and the thing is not totally set up yet. \u00a0 I did NOT notice any banding - none in any viewing done over these few days. \u00a0 One thing I can mention - I used HDMI-1 for Bell Satellite (PVR) and HDMI-2 for the Bluray player for movie viewing ... By default, the unit is configured to change settings on ALL inputs - change this to apply setting changes to affect only the input your viewing - If that's what you want ... I wasted a few hours tinkering with the Bluray for movies and went to the PVR input and tinkered there and lost all my Bluray settings - Argggh. \u00a0 Last word - I watched a few minutes of 'Lawrence of Arabia' on Bluray - I guess they can't make 'em like that any more - Anyway, the visuals are stunning but on this set they are jaw-dropping (My 2 cents) \u00a0 Let me know if you want any other info but it may take a while to report back - Once you turn on the H8000 Curved - It ain't easy to walk away.

But haven't noticed them during regular playback. My TV is in a low light viewing area and I had a smidge of clouding that I eliminated by turning down the backlight a bit and I have on Smart LED (standard) I've heard there are issues with apps in the smart hub, but I don't use those so I couldn't speak to that. I would definitely recommend this TV if you are looking for a non 4k TV! Panel is a TD02. "

Banding, but that tends to vary. Though you will find people in the thread for that TV with similar problems. I game as well, I'm sure there is input lag, but I don't notice it like most people. All these TVs have a \"game mode\" to combat the issue. If you're able test them both, see which one you feel better with. "

I returned them and waited for the H8000, but then actually decided to go for the HU9000. Uniformity on the curved screen is much better than the 850a, so far from what I have read the H8000 is doing real well with uniformity too.. just for that I would go with the 8000 over the 850a. "

"description": "   Good day everyone,  I purchased the 65H8000 this past weekend mainly for games. I was worried about the input lag. I happen to also own the LEO BODNAR input lag tester. With the Firmware 1120 ( which is what the tv was at when I got it) the Game mode was getting 48ms, which is beyond the threshold that I can feel. I personally start to feel input lag with tv/monitors over 40ms. IN PC mode the tv was getting very eradic numbers, but they were from 48-68ms which is way too high for me.  So I had read reviews of the 55 inch version getting 35ms. I figured because this tv is the 65 inch larger version that is why the lag was higher. I updated the firmware last nite to 1130. Then retried with the Leo Bodnar device. Game mode was now getting 38 ms and this was with Smart LED on low, not bad!  Then I tried PC mode because you get 4:4:4 chroma and I prefer that for games. It is now getting 35.4ms!!!  So those thinking on getting the 55 because it has less lag, now you don't have to worry about getting  the larger 65 as it has the same input lag numbers. Very happy with this!  Also, for reference I also have the Samsung 55F7100 that D-Nice ISF calibrated, this tv has 40MS of input lag in Game or PC mode. I would without a doubt say the H8000 is a much better panel then the F7100 in all respects. The H8000's must have a totally new panel, because even at 6 backlight, its way brighter then the F7100 at 6 backlight.  Any questions please ask! "

"description": "   So I just got off the phone with Samsung Canada.  I can confirm that the Canadian model UN65H8000FZXC DOES have hardware based local Dimming.  You can't set it at any level, it's automatically on and there is NO level to control.  Subsequently, the US version has no option to control it either ( at least not in the entire manual )  So for all the Canadian customers, no one was left out, we do have it and on ALL screen sizes.  for the UK people, I would call to confirm if it's available.  I have the 65\" and I haven't had any issues with the black levels.  I am going to get it calibrated probably within the month, depending on the availability of the calibrator. "

Realistic ultra-clean, high quality, low noise images, excellent flesh tones, excellent detail, saturated color, deep inky black in every scene.  I believed (imagined otherwise) that both shows as listed looked as if the H8000 was monitoring at the show set live in the control booth. Both broadcast looked exceptional, reference quality.

"description": "   Has there been any sort of comparison whatsoever on black level/contrast between the H8000 and the HU9000? Samsung seem to be the only company this year to have released an actual flagship 1080p set and Im curious how it stacks up, as it seemingly has essentially every single feature from the 9000, except \"purcolor\" and a drop from 1400 to 1200 MCR (though the 8000 has a 240hz native panel...) Putting aside 4k content, I wonder how the two would stack up when playing 1080p content... "

"description": "   Hello. Did everyone leave? This thread has been quiet for a few days. Usually this is about the time people begin finding issues with their new toys and start complaining. But, apparently this television is different than the usual, and people are enjoying the new purchase. If this is true then this TV is worth the steep price tag. How difficult is it to place the stand assembly onto the set out of the box? I'm guessing that with the curved screen, extra care must be taken when laying it down to prevent damage. Or do you simply set the television down onto the stand upright, like the way Panny plasmas are stand mounted? Thanks guys congrats on your new sets. I have a Mits DLP that is starting to show signs of chip failure (specks/spots visible during dark scenes or when screen is blank/no input) so the 65 is looking like a prime replacement. Of course it's cheaper to fix, but 10,000:1 contrast ratio is a little passe these days. "

My price was $2799, and now the price shows on their site, $3399.  I hope I'm not getting a refurb.  Wonder where the set is coming from.  Site has been quiet.  Wonder when an official UNxxH8000 thread will open up. "

"description": "   I got mine yesterday. 65 inch version. Big time white clouding in all four corners of the screen. It's there on every input and source. It's there on my Blu ray player, bell dish, etc. etc. I've tried different cables and did the factory reset. I  unplugged the unit for an hour. I'm out of options. The only way to make it less noticeable is to lower the contrast and backlight settings so low that it ruins the picture. I tried the cloth deal from above, it didn't help. I'll be calling Samsung Monday Morning. Outside of the clouding issue I really enjoyed the set. Set up was a breeze. That little smart remote which I'd thought I would hate is so easy to use. I love it. Picture for movies and sports was tremendous. Broadcast TV like fox and nbc with their 1 hour dramas were not nearly as good as film and sport. I'm going to put in moon goo's settings now and see what they are like. The TV is a breeze to assemble. Like pointed out earlier, stand is very flimsy. I make sure to hold on to set when plugging and pulling out cables. I paid 2900 Canadian cash for the set in Toronto before tax and warranty. That's it, that's all I got. What are the odds on this?

The picture is beautiful compared to the f8000 I had, but the f8000 had better blacks and backlight uniformity. I have two rather medium size circles of what looks like clouding or flashlighting.
